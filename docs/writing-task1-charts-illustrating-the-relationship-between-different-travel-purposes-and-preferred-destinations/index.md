# Writing Task1: Charts Illustrating the Relationship Between Different Travel Purposes and Preferred Destinations


#### My Writing:

The statistical charts display the figures in numbers and the correlation between different reasons and destinations over the years from 1994 to 1998. In this investigation, 100,000 people from the UK participated.
 
Overall, the survey shows that UK residents preferred travelling to Western Europe during holidays, and there was a steady increase except in 1994.

To begin with, the most notable feature was seen in the category of 'Holiday' in 1994, with 15,246, and it increased dramatically by 1998, with 20,700. Following that, 'Business' was recorded starting with 3155, experiencing a continuous increase, and it reached 3181 by the end.
This was followed by 'Visit to friends and relatives', showing a similar trend to Holiday, which increased considerably from 1,689 to 3,051. With regard to 'Other reasons', it presented an irregular tendency, and figures ranged from 896 to 1,054.

Turning to destinations, Western Euope showed the most outstanding feature, increasing from 19,371 in 1994 to 24,519 in 1998. Both 'Other areas' and 'North America' had a proportional pattern where the former increased from 1,782 to 2,846 while the latter climbed from 919 to 1,923. (184 words)
