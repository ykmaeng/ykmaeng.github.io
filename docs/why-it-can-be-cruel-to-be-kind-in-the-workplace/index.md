Alongside the predictable specifications for a job vacancy at the Financial Times — problem-solving, tenacity, and so on — is one I haven’t seen before. The ideal candidate must “`exude kindness`”.

As a rule, I would say that if you are actually `sweating a quality`, you are probably trying too hard. Nobody thinks “he oozes niceness” is a compliment. The requirement does, however, raise an interesting question: at work, how much kindness is enough, and how much is too much?

It is a cruel world. Harshness is the tenor of much dialogue, from the US president down. Simple kindness may well make the difference between contentment and misery.

That is the attitude Kind Snacks is out to promote. Its mission is to “make the world a little kinder”. Its website positively drips with benevolence.

Kind has set up a Kind Foundation, fostering “kinder and more empathetic communities”; it hands out #kindawesome cards when it sees someone being kind; it offers tips about how to be kind every day. Last week, Mars bought a minority stake and is ready to push Kind’s sticky bars and their somewhat cloying message into even more countries.

Much of Kind’s activity is marketing — the token of Kind’s appreciation for acts of kindness is a free snack — and some approaches the border of creepiness. This was the week Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with Garrison Keillor, whose Lake Wobegon is a fictional archetype of a kind, compassionate community, while it looked into allegations of “inappropriate behaviour”. It may not be the moment to “`drop a loving note` into a friend’s bag for them to discover later” — one of Kind’s tips — unless you know that friend very well, or don’t mind if your human resources Swat team pays you an urgent visit.

Yet there is a kernel of truth behind the flummery. Kind makes a useful distinction between mere niceness, which is passive, and active kindness. Its founder Daniel Lubetzky was inspired by his father’s tale of how he survived Dachau, in part because of the unexpected kindness of a concentration camp guard, who broke the rules to give him a rotten potato.

What is more, research confirms workplace warmheartedness has wider benefits. A University of California study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behaviour — “`paying it forward`” — while givers and receivers felt a greater sense of autonomy, and were happier all around.

Another study in the Academy of Management Journal highlighted the importance of “companionate love” in the male-dominated world of firefighting. When combined with a culture of “joviality”, acts of kindness — such as raising money to help a financially troubled colleague hang on to his house — moderated risk-taking and reduced health problems triggered by the strain of balancing work and family.

As in so many other areas, though, kindness gets more complicated as people climb the corporate hierarchy. I suggested to some chief executives that one risk of including “decency” in your corporate values was that staff might consider you had broken your promise if you had to sack them. One promptly fired back, to widespread nodding, that a far graver breach would be to keep staff on at the expense of the company’s long-term health.

Companies are occasionally `killed by kindness`. The owner of Malden Mills, a Massachusetts textile company, rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire in 1995, instead of offshoring production. His benevolence backfired. He misread the global market and plunged everybody into bankruptcy. It was “a `cautionary tale` about adventures in the frontier” of efforts to make the world a better place, wrote academic Roger Martin.

Similarly, Etsy, the crafts market operating on the same frontier, has had to toughen its sensitive side and ditch its folksy chief executive to survive as a listed company. “Being good doesn’t `cut the mustard`,” its current CEO told the New York Times.

On the other hand, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, sees no contradiction between `making hard calls` — he has had to lay off thousands of staff since taking over — and being an empathetic leader. “You should carry out those decisions with empathy,” he told me recently.

Kindness and corporate success are not mutually exclusive, but balancing the two is a fine art. One of the hardest pieces of advice to new managers is to distance themselves from ex-teammates. Too often, they take this as an invitation to start behaving coldly. But a manager who exudes kindness all the time risks destroying the trust of his team, when, inevitably, what seems the kindest thing to do clashes with what is the right thing.

### Killed by Kindness

This phrase is used to denote a situation where one's good intentions or excessive generosity lead to negative outcomes. This is often because the kindness is inappropriate for the situation or is simply too much. 

<font color="#009999">Example: The owner of Malden Mills rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire, instead of moving production overseas. His good intentions, however, misjudged the global market situation and led to bankruptcy. In this case, the company was "killed by kindness".</font>

### Cautionary Tale

A "cautionary tale" refers to a story or an anecdote that's used as a warning to others. It shows what could potentially go wrong if a specific course of action is pursued. 

<font color="009999">Example: The story of Malden Mills could be considered a "cautionary tale" about the risks of excessive kindness in business. It serves as a warning to other companies about the potential dangers of making decisions based purely on benevolence without considering the market realities.</font>

### Cut the Mustard

The phrase "cut the mustard" means to meet a required standard, or to be able to handle a task or job. 

<font color="009999">Example: When Etsy became a listed company, it needed to toughen up and become more business-oriented. Its original, folksy CEO didn't "cut the mustard" - he wasn't able to meet the demands of the new situation.</font>

### Make a Hard Call

To "make a hard call" means to make a difficult decision, often one that might be unpopular or have negative consequences for some people.

<font color="009999">Example: Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had to "make a hard call" when he laid off thousands of staff after taking over the company. Despite the negative impact on those who lost their jobs, he believed it was necessary for the long-term health of the company.</font>

### Exude Kindness

To "exude kindness" means to demonstrate a high level of kindness in one's behavior or presence. It implies that kindness is a noticeable part of one's character.

<font color="009999">Example: The ideal candidate for a job at the Financial Times was expected to "exude kindness", signaling the importance of this quality in the workplace.</font>

### Sweating a Quality

The phrase "sweating a quality" means trying too hard to demonstrate a particular attribute or trait, to the point where it may appear insincere or excessive.

<font color="009999">Example: If a person is perceived as "sweating kindness", it might suggest that they are forcing themselves to be kind rather than it being a natural part of their character.</font>

### Pay it Forward

To "pay it forward" means to respond to a kind gesture by being kind to someone else, rather than by repaying the original benefactor.

<font color="009999">Example: A study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed that workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behavior by "paying it forward".</font>

### Drop a Loving Note

"Dropping a loving note" refers to the act of leaving a kind or loving message for someone to find unexpectedly.

<font color="009999">Example: Kind Snacks suggested to "drop a loving note into a friend’s bag for them to discover later" as a way to spread kindness, though it’s important to consider the appropriateness of this action depending on the relationship.</font>
