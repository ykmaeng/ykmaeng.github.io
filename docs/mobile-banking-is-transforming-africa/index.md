# Mobile banking is transforming Africa


Imagine you live in rural Kenya, and your daughter attends university in Nairobi and needs help to buy books and pay the rent. How do you send money without a bank account or the internet? Some countries have various options, including PayPal, online banking, or `money orders`. However, many people in rural communities don't have access to basic banking services such as direct debit. There are two billion `'unbanked' adults` in developing countries that cannot make transactions or transfer money. Their `credit cards` are unstable because they have no way to save for the future.

Giving people access to banking is called `'financial inclusion'`. By lowering the cost of transactions, financial inclusion encourages economic growth. Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with `mobile banking`. It is easy to use, has low fees, and doesn't involve credit cards. All you need is an old mobile phone, and money is sent via text messages. Most customers use it for `person-to-person (P2P) payments`, but some use it to pay `utility bills`.
