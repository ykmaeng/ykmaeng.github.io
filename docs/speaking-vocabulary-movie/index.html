            <i class="icon fas fa-question-circle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>1. Describe your favourite movie<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>My favourite movie is &ldquo;The Pursuit of Happyness&rdquo;, which I first watched about two years ago. This film comes vividly to mind because it left a deep impression on me. It&rsquo;s based on the true story of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman who becomes a successful stockbroker despite numerous obstacles.</p>
<p>The film, set in the 1980s, beautifully portrays American culture and the economic struggles many individuals faced. The storyline is full of suspense and is quite unpredictable, which makes it all the more captivating. It&rsquo;s not your regular comedy or thriller; it&rsquo;s a meaningful drama that brings a mix of emotions. At times, it&rsquo;s so touching that it brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>Will Smith, who plays Chris Gardner, delivers an awe-inspiring performance. His portrayal makes the film seem more like an autobiography than a fictional story. This movie was a blockbuster hit and is frequently regarded as an evergreen symbol of parental love and determination.</p>
<p>One scene that stands out to me is when Chris finally gets the job after countless hardships. This was a turning point in his life and resonates with me deeply, reminding me of some of my own struggles.</p>
<p>Looking back, &ldquo;The Pursuit of Happyness&rdquo; is more than just a film. It brings back nostalgic memories and teaches valuable life lessons. From this movie, I learned that perseverance and hard work can overcome any obstacles. This is a lesson that has stuck with me and continues to influence my daily life.</p>

The storyline, instead of being full of suspense, was quite foreseeable, lacking the element of surprise that usually accompanies a thriller. Comedy was infused in awkward situations, making it less amusing and more cringe-worthy.</p>
<p>Additionally, it attempted to portray a certain culture, but it felt more like a caricature than a true representation. The portrayal was so off the mark that it brought tears to my eyes, but not out of emotional connection, rather due to the sheer disappointment.</p>
<p>The movie was promoted as a one-of-a-kind experience, but it was far from it. The plot was not meaningful, the characters lacked depth, and the whole experience in the theatre felt more like a test of patience than an enjoyable evening at the cinema.</p>
<p>The good value that I learnt from this movie is that not every hyped movie is worth the watch. Sometimes, making informed decisions based on reviews and personal preferences is a better approach than falling for marketing gimmicks. Despite its status as a bestseller at the box office, this movie, for me, was far from evergreen and has faded with my memory&rsquo;s age.</p>

            <div class="admonition-content"><p>If I remember correctly, the TV programme that always brings nostalgic memories and holds a special place in my heart is a comedy series that aired some years ago. This programme is one of a kind, full of witty humour and is based on a fictional story about a group of friends.</p>
<p>This series is a comedy, but it&rsquo;s also meaningful, portraying friendship and everyday life struggles in a light-hearted and relatable manner. What makes it even more special is how it portrays diverse cultures and personalities, making it a melting pot of experiences. It&rsquo;s not just a sitcom; it&rsquo;s a symbol of friendship and the highs and lows that come with it.</p>
<p>Even though the series ended a while back, it remains evergreen, and I often find myself revisiting the episodes. Each time, I find something new to laugh about or a new perspective that I hadn&rsquo;t considered before. It&rsquo;s amusing, captivating, and full of suspense in its way, with the storyline often taking unpredictable turns.</p>
<p>The characters in the series are relatable and well-rounded, and over time, they have turned yellow with age in the sense that they have matured and evolved, much like the pages of an old, beloved book. This TV programme is like a beloved novel whose spine has faded with age but holds stories that are timeless and impactful.</p>
<p>The good value that I learnt from this TV programme is that friendship is a beautiful journey of growth, understanding, and mutual respect. And despite the hurdles life throws at us, a good laugh with friends can make everything seem better. No matter how many new shows I watch, this programme remains my favourite, a true evergreen in the vast television landscape.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>A moment that comes vividly to mind when I think of something funny that I&rsquo;ve experienced occurred approximately two years ago. It was not a comedy show or a movie but a real-life incident that had all the elements of a comedy, full of suspense, and utterly unpredictable.</p>
<p>The incident involved my friends and I on a road trip. If my memory serves me right, we were trying to navigate our way through a foreign city using a map that was, unfortunately, outdated. The comedy of errors ensued when we ended up at a farm, thinking it was a famous tourist spot. The sight of us, city folks, amidst cows and haystacks, was so amusing that tears welled in our eyes from the laughter.</p>
<p>The situation was so meaningful because, despite being lost and slightly embarrassed, we found joy and humour. The incident, in a way, became a symbol of our friendship, showing that we could find laughter even in the most unexpected situations. It was a turning point in our trip, turning a potentially frustrating situation into a memorable and hilarious adventure.</p>
<p>This memory has faded with age in the sense that the details are not as clear as they once were, but the laughter and the feeling of togetherness it brought are evergreen. The good value I learnt from this experience is that life doesn&rsquo;t always go as planned, but if we embrace the unexpected with a sense of humour, it can lead to some extraordinary memories. It&rsquo;s an incident that I often recount at gatherings, and each time, it never fails to bring a round of laughter.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>When it comes to advertising, my favourite has always been an old Coca-Cola commercial that aired around the holiday season. This advertisement, despite its simplicity, was incredibly captivating and left an indelible impression on me.</p>
<p>The advertisement started with the jingle of a bell, followed by the chugging sound of a train. As the camera panned out, it revealed a magical train made entirely of red and white lights, driving through a snowy landscape. This was the iconic Coca-Cola Christmas train, delivering bottles of the refreshing beverage to the inhabitants of the sleepy town. The townspeople, young and old, would hear the train&rsquo;s whistle and rush out to receive their holiday treat, their faces alight with joy and anticipation.</p>
<p>What made this advertisement truly special was its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia and warmth, perfectly capturing the spirit of the holiday season. The ad did not rely on flashy visuals or clever wordplay. Instead, it used the universal language of joy, generosity, and celebration. Even though the advertisement was for a beverage, it felt like it was selling a feeling, a moment of togetherness.</p>
<p>This ad remains my favourite to this day, a timeless classic in the world of advertising. It taught me the good value of associating a product with positive emotions and experiences. Despite its age, it still feels fresh and relevant, a testament to the power of storytelling in advertising. Each time I hear the jingle of that bell, I am transported back to those magical holiday seasons, and I can&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>One of my most cherished shared experiences was a book exchange I had with a close friend during our college years. Both of us were literature enthusiasts, and we had a profound love for books, their smell, the feel of their pages, and the worlds they contained within their covers.</p>
<p>The book was Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez‚Äôs &ldquo;One Hundred Years of Solitude.&rdquo; I had read it over the summer break and was deeply moved by the intricate narrative, the magical realism, and the vivid character portrayals. Knowing my friend&rsquo;s penchant for such narratives, I decided to share it with her.</p>
<p>I remember the day I handed the book to her. The way her eyes lit up as she read the title, the eagerness in her voice as she flipped through the pages, it was almost as if I was reliving my initial interactions with the book.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we would discuss the book at length, dissecting its themes, characters, and narrative style. We would debate and sometimes even argue about our interpretations of the book. But what made this sharing so special was the connection it fostered between us. It deepened our bond and added a new layer to our friendship.</p>
<p>Sharing that book was more than just an exchange of a physical object. It was an exchange of thoughts, ideas, and emotions that we experienced through the journey of reading that book. It was a shared experience that opened up new conversations, new understandings, and a new level of intimacy in our friendship. To this day, each time I see that book on my shelf, I am reminded of those enriching discussions and the joy of sharing something so meaningful with a dear friend.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>One of the most exhilarating sports activities that I remember watching on TV was the 2023 NBA Finals. The keenly contested series featured the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, two teams with star-studded lineups and a deep-seated rivalry.</p>
<p>The deciding game 7 was an absolute thriller. The entire match was a roller coaster ride, with the lead changing hands multiple times. The Lakers, led by their charismatic point guard, put forth a brilliant first half. Their swift passing, precise shooting, and aggressive defense had them leading by a comfortable margin as the halftime buzzer sounded.</p>
<p>However, the Brooklyn Nets, known for their resilience, staged a remarkable comeback in the second half. Their star player, an exceptional shooter, seemed to have taken it upon himself to pilot the team&rsquo;s comeback. He made some unbelievable three-pointers, showing remarkable poise under pressure.</p>
<p>As the final minutes ticked down, the intensity was palpable. With just seconds remaining, the game was tied, and the Lakers had the ball. The point guard, who had been instrumental in the Lakers&rsquo; initial lead, took control. He dribbled past the defenders and launched a three-pointer just as the buzzer sounded. The ball arched high in the air and swished through the net, sealing a memorable victory for the Lakers.</p>
<p>The players erupted in joy, and the crowd roared in approval. The stunning last-second shot, the dramatic comeback from the Nets, and the high stakes of the match made it one of the most exciting sports activities I&rsquo;ve ever watched on TV. The game was a testament to the sheer unpredictability and thrill of sports, and it is a match I will remember for a long time to come.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>One book that I&rsquo;ve revisited multiple times is &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; by Harper Lee. This classic novel is a powerful exploration of themes such as racial injustice, moral growth, and the inherent goodness and evil in people.</p>
<p>The story is set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression, and it&rsquo;s narrated by a young girl named Scout Finch. Through her innocent and insightful perspective, we&rsquo;re introduced to her father, Atticus Finch, an attorney who embodies integrity and empathy. Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of a grave crime. The narrative intertwines with Scout&rsquo;s own journey of growing up, her interactions with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, and their fascination with their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley.</p>
<p>Each read of &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; reveals new layers. In my first reading, I was deeply moved by the blatant racial inequality and the courage of Atticus Finch in standing up against it. In subsequent readings, however, I began to appreciate subtler aspects of the book such as the character growth of Scout, the symbolism of the &lsquo;mockingbird&rsquo;, and the delicate portrayal of the South during this tumultuous time.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s exploration of moral complexities and its rich character development make it a compelling read, no matter how many times you&rsquo;ve been through it. Each reread offers a new perspective, a deeper understanding, or a previously overlooked detail. That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo; remains for me, and many others, a book that&rsquo;s worth revisiting time and again.</p>

            <div class="admonition-content"><p>A compelling film based on true events that comes to mind is &ldquo;The Pursuit of Happyness&rdquo; directed by Gabriele Muccino. The film portrays the inspiring life story of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman turned successful stockbroker.</p>
<p>The movie, released in 2006, stars Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a role that earned him an Academy Award nomination. His real-life son, Jaden Smith, plays his on-screen son, adding a unique authenticity to their relationship.</p>
<p>The story unfolds in San Francisco in the 1980s, where Gardner invests his life savings into portable bone density scanners. However, the devices don&rsquo;t sell well, plunging Gardner and his son into financial turmoil. His wife leaves him, and they lose their home, forcing father and son to navigate life in homeless shelters and even a public restroom at a subway station.</p>
<p>Despite these hardships, Gardner doesn&rsquo;t lose hope. He lands an unpaid internship at a prestigious brokerage firm with the promise of a job at the end if he can outshine his competitors. The film beautifully captures Gardner&rsquo;s relentless pursuit of a better life for him and his son, despite numerous setbacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pursuit of Happyness&rdquo; is an emotional, inspiring journey that showcases the resilience of the human spirit and the power of perseverance. It&rsquo;s a heartwarming testament to the fact that sometimes, the most extraordinary stories are the ones that happen in real life.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>If my memory serves me right, a film that comes vividly to mind when talking about the future is the blockbuster &ldquo;Blade Runner,&rdquo; directed by Ridley Scott. I watched this film about two years ago and its depiction of a dystopian future is based on a fictional story but is full of suspense and thought-provoking concepts, making it a one of a kind experience.</p>
<p>The storyline is set in future Los Angeles, where bioengineered beings known as replicants, who are almost indistinguishable from humans, are created. These replicants are the product of powerful corporations, and the movie portrays a future culture where the line between machine and human is blurred.</p>
<p>The film is a thriller, full of suspense as it follows the main character, Rick Deckard, who is tasked with hunting down and &ldquo;retiring&rdquo; replicants. His journey is unpredictable and evergreen, offering fresh insights with each viewing. The scenes are captivating, and at times, it brought tears to my eyes with its exploration of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>The film was a turning point in my life, causing me to reflect on the potential impact of unchecked technological advancement on our society. It&rsquo;s a symbol of cautionary future, where the value of life, whether human or artificial, becomes the central question. The good value that I learnt from this film is that humanity is defined not just by our biological make-up but by our emotions, experiences, and capacity for empathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blade Runner&rdquo; is often showcased in cinemas and is considered an evergreen in the realm of science fiction. This film, while not a comedy or love story, has an underlying layer of a tragic love story that adds depth to its narrative. Looking back, it brings nostalgic memories of my first encounter with such profound cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, &ldquo;Blade Runner&rdquo; is not just a movie about the future, but a timeless exploration of identity, consciousness, and the ethical implications of advancing technology.</p>

<p>In conclusion, &ldquo;Parasite&rdquo; is a captivating and thought-provoking foreign film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Its masterful storytelling, profound social commentary, and exceptional performances make it a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with me.</p>
