# Manager or Mentor? Why You Must Be Both

An article from Harvard Business School Working Knowledge emphasizes the importance of managers acting as both performance evaluators and mentors. Here are some key insights from the article:

## Developmental Relationships

The term "developmental relationship" is used to describe the relationship a manager forms with their employees. This relationship extends beyond traditional mentoring or managing, and the individual's work experience can be heavily influenced by it. Notably, this relationship can be affected by racial or gender lines.

## Managing for Performance vs Development

Managers who focus solely on performance metrics are more likely to be caught off guard by events they could have anticipated. This could include the sudden departure of a star employee for a better opportunity, or an employee feeling discouraged because they believe the organization is not supporting them. To prevent these situations, managers should strive to create an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing their experiences and roles, not just their performance.

## Persistence and Consistency

When forming developmental relationships with employees, persistence and consistency are key. If an employee seems resistant at first, a manager should continue to engage them in a developmental way. This might involve asking about the employee's future plans or suggesting training opportunities that could be beneficial.
