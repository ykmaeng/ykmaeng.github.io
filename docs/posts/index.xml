    <description><![CDATA[등교 첫 날 집을 나서기 전 뉴질랜드는 1학년부터 13학년까지 1년에 4학기제로 운영된다. 만 5살이 되면 1학년에 입학할 자격이 주어지고 텀(학기)이 시작될 때 수업에 참여할 수 있다. 한국의 초등학교처럼 입학식을 하지는 않고, 학교가는 해에 유치원에서 졸업파티를 성대학게(?) 해주는 것 같다. 다니엘은 지난 주 내내 감기 때문에 아파서 졸업식을 못했다. 코로나처럼 심하게 앓은 탓에 등교 첫 날 결석을 해야할까봐 노심초사 했지만, 다행히 기침만 남기고 열은 떨어져서 무사히 등교할 수 있었다. 물론 아침에 &lsquo;학교가기 무섭네, 엄마랑 떨어지기 싫네&rsquo;라며 눈물을 글썽이며 어린양을 했지만 안가고 별 수 있나.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[집에서 바라본 마을 전경 평범한 오후, 나는 따스한 햇살을 받으며 창가에 앉아 있다. 시간은 느리게 흘러가고, 마음의 한 켠에서 먼지 쌓여가는 오래된 기억들이 잠에서 깨어난다. 갑작스레 찾아온 이 여유로운 시간 속에 커피가 빠질 수 없다.
소박해 보일 수 있는 물 끓이는 순간에도, 행복은 스며든다. 뜨거운 물이 점점 끓어올라가는 모습을 바라보며, 나는 미래에 대한 무게감을 잠시 내려놓는다. 창 밖으로 보이는 푸른 나무들과 붙박이 집들, 그 안정감이 나를 감싸 안는다.
그때, 앞집의 고양이가 마실을 나온다.]]></description>
