# Writing Task 1: Bar Chart Showing Four Modes of Transport From 1950 to 1990


#### My Writing (Band 6.5):

The bar chart displays the proportions of four different types used to commute to work in a European city. This survey was conducted every two decades, from 1950 to 1990.

Overall, ~~it represents that~~, at the beginning of the survey, more eco-friendly tools, such as walking and bicycles, were the primary modes of transportation, whereas commuting by car became the principle means at the end of the investigation.

To begin with, in 1950, commuting on foot recorded the highest with 35%, and this was followed by bike, bus, and car in order. Regarding foot, there was a dramatic decrease until 1990; 5% was shown as the proportion. As for bus, it presented a similar trend to foot, starting at 30% and falling ~~down~~ to 5%. In terms of the bus, it showed marginal changes, going from 20% at first to 25% and then 15% in the end. Turning to the car, it was depicted as an exponential increase, beginning at 5% and reaching 35%. (161 words)

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of commuters who used four different types of transportation to travel to work in a European city in four different years, from 1950 to 1990. The types of transportation are walking, cycling, bus, and car.

The main trend that can be observed from the chart is the significant shift from more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, to car use over the four decades.

In 1950, walking was the most popular mode of transportation, with 35% of commuters choosing this option. However, by 1990, this proportion had plummeted to only 5%. A similar decline can be seen for bus use, which fell from 30% in 1950 to 5% in 1990.

In contrast, cycling showed minor variations over time, starting at 20% in 1950, reaching a peak of 25% in 1970, and then dropping to 15% by 1990. Cycling was the second most preferred mode of transportation in all years except for 1990.

Car use exhibited a remarkable increase over the period, starting at a mere 5% in 1950 and soaring to 35% by 1990. By the end of the period, car use had become the dominant mode of transportation for commuters in the city. (200 words)
