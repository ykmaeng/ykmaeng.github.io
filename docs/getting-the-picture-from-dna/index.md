# Getting the Picture From DNA


_Working out what someone looks like from only a DNA sample is no longer science fiction. You'd be surprised what forensics experts can already do, says Clare Wilson._

At present, if police find DNA which could be that of the criminal at the scene of a crime (for example in blood or hair), standard `forensic techniques` can help in two ways. If there’s a suspect in custody, the police can see if their DNA matches the “crime stain”, as it is called. Or in the absence of a suspect, they can see if it matches the DNA of any known criminal held in their archives.

Both techniques have proved their worth in criminal investigations. But what if there’s no suspect and no match in the archive? Even since DNA testing was introduced, forensic scientists have wondered how much a DNA sample on its own could tell them about what a criminal might look like.

Scientists have already had some success with predicting hair color from DNA samples. For example, researchers at Britain’s Forensic Science Service (FSS) have developed a DNA test which will tell with 98% accuracy whether or not someone has red hair. However, the red-hair test is of limited use in Britain, where only 6% of the population are red-haired. What about blonde, brown and black-haired criminals? Hair color is usually determined by the `cumulative effect` of several genes, so unfortunately there’s no such thing as a single gene for blonde hair that could be turned into a simple test, for example. It’s the same with eye color.

But biotechnology firm DNA Print Genomics of Florida, USA, is having a crack at both problems. As a starting point, research was carried out using mice to discover the genes that controlled eye color. Similar sequences in human DNA were then investigated, and ten possible genes were found. Next, the DNA Print researchers took DNA samples from 500 volunteers and recorded their eye colors. They then applied a technique called SNP mapping to see if they could discover any correlations between the two. (SNP stands for '`single nucleotide polymorphism`' — a single ‘letter’ change in the genetic code. These variations account for most of the genetic differences between individuals.) The researchers sequenced the ten possible genes from each volunteer, then sifted through the sequences looking for SNPs. They found 50 in total. Then they set computers to work out how the SNPs `correlated with` eye color. Of the ten genes, they found that only four really matter. By looking at these, they can classify someone as having dark eyes (blue and grey), or hazel eyes (greenish-brown) — with 97% certainty.

DNA Print is now applying exactly the same technique to hair color, identifying possible genes and looking for SNPs. Representatives say they have made some headway and can classify people into one of three groups — blonde, brown or black-haired- with some accuracy, from their DNA alone.

Back in Britain, the Forensic Science Service has also been `pursuing the genetic basis of` facial features. A few years ago it helped fund a major project carried out by scientists at University College London (UCL). Over several months, an exhibit at a London museum invited visitors to leave DNA samples and have their faces scanned using `3D surface mapping`. About 600 people volunteered. The UCL researchers tried to `break down this data` on overall facial nose curvature or chin clefts, and correlate them to DNA sequences. But they made little progress. Just as with eye color, there is no one gene for a big nose, so the `enormous complexity of the task` defeated the researchers. When the lead scientists retired, the project was wound down without drawing any firm conclusions.

But the idea of finding genes for facial features isn’t dead. Many of the genes involved are common to most mammals. So a gene for a large jaw in mice, for example, might very well be found in humans, too. One promising project has found that mice show significant variation in jaw shape and size, and has begun to `unravel the genetics` behind the variation. Project leader Chris Klingenberg of the University of Konstanz in Germany `cautions that`, as with humans, the genetics controlling jaw shape in mice is horribly complicated, but the project is making some progress. In one study of 535 mice, it has identified genes for jaw shape, jaw size and jaw symmetry and round two basic patterns resulting from the combination of these genes.

The UK-based human rights group known as 'Liberty' has concerns, saying that the existing tests are not yet sufficiently conclusive to be used as a basis for arresting suspects. Certainly, genes never tell the whole story with physical characteristics - `environment plays a key role` too. Kevin Sullivan, from the Forensic Science Service, points out that when it comes to someone's facial characteristics, 'playing rugby might have more of an effect on your ear and nose shape than your genes.' But he is `optimistic about the future` of the research. 'Lay-abiding citizens don't have anything to worry about,' he says. 'But criminals do.'

1. **forensic techniques**  
Scientific methods and processes used in solving crimes. In the article, this refers to the methods used by police and scientists to analyze and interpret DNA found at crime scenes.

1. **cumulative effect**   
The combined effect of several factors. In the article, hair color is determined not by one, but by the combined effect of several genes.

1. **single nucleotide polymorphism" (SNP)**   
A variation at a single position in a DNA sequence among individuals. A technique called SNP mapping was used in the article to find correlations between DNA variations and eye color.

1. **3D surface mapping**   
A technique to create a three-dimensional representation of a surface. In the UCL research presented in the article, this technique was used to scan the faces of volunteers.

1. **correlate them to**   
To establish a relationship or connection between two sets of data. The UCL researchers in the article tried to connect facial features to specific DNA sequences.

1. **wound down**  
To bring something gradually to an end. The UCL research project was described in the article as gradually ending without significant results.

1. **firm conclusions**  
Definite and unambiguous findings or results. The UCL project in the article ended without arriving at any definitive findings.

1. **sufficiently conclusive**  
Adequately decisive or convincing. The human rights group "Liberty" in the article believes that current DNA tests are not convincing enough to be used for arrests.

1. **genes never tell the whole story**   
Genes alone can't account for or explain everything about a particular trait or characteristic. The article mentions that while genes play a role in determining physical characteristics, other factors, like the environment, also influence them.

1. **Lay-abiding citizens**  
Ordinary people who follow the law. In the article, these individuals shouldn't be concerned about the advancements in forensic research.

1. **sifted through**  
To examine something carefully in order to find something specific. In the article, researchers went through DNA sequences in detail looking for SNPs.

1. **correlated with**   
When one thing is related to or connected with another. In this context, researchers used computers to find out how SNPs were related to eye color.

1. **pursuing the genetic basis of** 
Actively researching or investigating the genetic foundation or cause of something. The Forensic Science Service in Britain was researching the genetic reasons behind facial features.

1. **break down this data**  
To analyze or separate data into smaller parts to better understand it. UCL researchers attempted to analyze and interpret data on facial features in relation to DNA sequences.
