<p>At present, if police find DNA which could be that of the criminal at the scene of a crime (for example in blood or hair), standard <code>forensic techniques</code> can help in two ways. If there‚Äôs a suspect in custody, the police can see if their DNA matches the ‚Äúcrime stain‚Äù, as it is called. Or in the absence of a suspect, they can see if it matches the DNA of any known criminal held in their archives.</p>
<p>Both techniques have proved their worth in criminal investigations. But what if there‚Äôs no suspect and no match in the archive? Even since DNA testing was introduced, forensic scientists have wondered how much a DNA sample on its own could tell them about what a criminal might look like.</p>
<p>Scientists have already had some success with predicting hair color from DNA samples. For example, researchers at Britain‚Äôs Forensic Science Service (FSS) have developed a DNA test which will tell with 98% accuracy whether or not someone has red hair. However, the red-hair test is of limited use in Britain, where only 6% of the population are red-haired. What about blonde, brown and black-haired criminals? Hair color is usually determined by the <code>cumulative effect</code> of several genes, so unfortunately there‚Äôs no such thing as a single gene for blonde hair that could be turned into a simple test, for example. It‚Äôs the same with eye color.</p>
<p>But biotechnology firm DNA Print Genomics of Florida, USA, is having a crack at both problems. As a starting point, research was carried out using mice to discover the genes that controlled eye color. Similar sequences in human DNA were then investigated, and ten possible genes were found. Next, the DNA Print researchers took DNA samples from 500 volunteers and recorded their eye colors. They then applied a technique called SNP mapping to see if they could discover any correlations between the two. (SNP stands for &lsquo;<code>single nucleotide polymorphism</code>&rsquo; ‚Äî a single ‚Äòletter‚Äô change in the genetic code. These variations account for most of the genetic differences between individuals.) The researchers sequenced the ten possible genes from each volunteer, then sifted through the sequences looking for SNPs. They found 50 in total. Then they set computers to work out how the SNPs <code>correlated with</code> eye color. Of the ten genes, they found that only four really matter. By looking at these, they can classify someone as having dark eyes (blue and grey), or hazel eyes (greenish-brown) ‚Äî with 97% certainty.</p>
<p>DNA Print is now applying exactly the same technique to hair color, identifying possible genes and looking for SNPs. Representatives say they have made some headway and can classify people into one of three groups ‚Äî blonde, brown or black-haired- with some accuracy, from their DNA alone.</p>
<p>Back in Britain, the Forensic Science Service has also been <code>pursuing the genetic basis of</code> facial features. A few years ago it helped fund a major project carried out by scientists at University College London (UCL). Over several months, an exhibit at a London museum invited visitors to leave DNA samples and have their faces scanned using <code>3D surface mapping</code>. About 600 people volunteered. The UCL researchers tried to <code>break down this data</code> on overall facial nose curvature or chin clefts, and correlate them to DNA sequences. But they made little progress. Just as with eye color, there is no one gene for a big nose, so the <code>enormous complexity of the task</code> defeated the researchers. When the lead scientists retired, the project was wound down without drawing any firm conclusions.</p>
<p>But the idea of finding genes for facial features isn‚Äôt dead. Many of the genes involved are common to most mammals. So a gene for a large jaw in mice, for example, might very well be found in humans, too. One promising project has found that mice show significant variation in jaw shape and size, and has begun to <code>unravel the genetics</code> behind the variation. Project leader Chris Klingenberg of the University of Konstanz in Germany <code>cautions that</code>, as with humans, the genetics controlling jaw shape in mice is horribly complicated, but the project is making some progress. In one study of 535 mice, it has identified genes for jaw shape, jaw size and jaw symmetry and round two basic patterns resulting from the combination of these genes.</p>
<p>The UK-based human rights group known as &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo; has concerns, saying that the existing tests are not yet sufficiently conclusive to be used as a basis for arresting suspects. Certainly, genes never tell the whole story with physical characteristics - <code>environment plays a key role</code> too. Kevin Sullivan, from the Forensic Science Service, points out that when it comes to someone&rsquo;s facial characteristics, &lsquo;playing rugby might have more of an effect on your ear and nose shape than your genes.&rsquo; But he is <code>optimistic about the future</code> of the research. &lsquo;Lay-abiding citizens don&rsquo;t have anything to worry about,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;But criminals do.&rsquo;</p>
