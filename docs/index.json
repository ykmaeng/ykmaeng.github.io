This interconnectedness, referred to as globalisation, is blurring the lines between distinct cultures, leading many to fear the eventual dissolution of cultural identities. I concur with this perspective, believing that unchecked globalisation poses a significant threat to the preservation of unique cultural heritages. Body Paragraph 1: Homogenization of Cultures At the forefront of the consequences of globalisation is the homogenization of cultures. As global brands dominate markets and Western entertainment becomes ubiquitous, local traditions and customs are often overshadowed. The ubiquity of global franchises, from fast food chains to clothing brands, means that cities across the world are beginning to look strikingly similar. Consequently, the rich tapestry of diverse cultural practices is at risk of being replaced by a monolithic global culture. Body Paragraph 2: Language Extinction Another alarming consequence of globalisation is the extinction of languages. As English becomes the de facto language of business, education, and the internet, many indigenous languages are dwindling, with some on the brink of extinction. With the loss of a language comes the loss of a unique worldview, folklore, and cultural practices, leading to an immeasurable cultural impoverishment. Conclusion In conclusion, while globalisation brings with it numerous benefits, including economic growth and increased access to information, its unchecked progression threatens the rich mosaic of world cultures. It is imperative that as we embrace globalisation, we also find ways to protect and preserve the myriad of cultural identities that make our world so beautifully diverse.

While some argue that this interconnectedness is erasing cultural identities, I firmly believe that globalisation, if approached correctly, can be a catalyst for cultural preservation and appreciation. Body Paragraph 1: Amplification of Local Cultures Rather than eradicating local cultures, globalisation often serves as a platform for their amplification. Local artists, musicians, and craftsmen now have global audiences at their fingertips, thanks to the internet and social media. This global exposure not only provides economic benefits but also fosters a deeper appreciation and understanding of diverse cultures. Festivals, cuisines, and traditions that were once limited to specific regions are now celebrated and enjoyed worldwide. Body Paragraph 2: Cross-cultural Collaborations Globalisation has facilitated unprecedented levels of cross-cultural collaborations. Musicians from different parts of the world collaborate to produce fusion genres, chefs experiment with cross-cultural cuisines, and filmmakers weave stories that transcend national boundaries. These collaborations not only enrich the global cultural tapestry but also ensure that individual cultures evolve while retaining their core essence. Conclusion In sum, globalisation doesn’t necessarily spell the end of cultural identities. Instead, with the right mindset and approach, it can be leveraged to promote, preserve, and evolve these identities in the global arena. As societies become more interconnected, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that the world’s diverse cultures are celebrated and cherished.

An Example of an Essay As globalization surges forward, the act of migrating to foreign lands has become a common phenomenon. A debate arises: Should migrants adopt the national lifestyle of their new home, or should a harmonious blend of cultures be encouraged? This essay will explore both viewpoints. To begin with, there are undeniable merits to immigrants integrating into the national lifestyle of their host country. By doing so, they equip themselves with guidelines that aid their smooth transition into unfamiliar territories. It not only helps them avert potential misunderstandings stemming from ignorance but also serves as a profound gesture of respect towards the native culture. Adopting the national lifestyle narrows the cultural chasm, fostering a sense of belonging. In doing so, a harmonious atmosphere is birthed, where cultural disparities are minimized, and unity is promoted. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, embracing the national lifestyle seems to be a logical approach for immigrants. On the other hand, a society where both immigrants and locals recognize and appreciate varied cultures offers its own set of advantages. Such an environment paves the way for a vibrant exchange of cultural ideas, broadening the horizons of all inhabitants. This mutual understanding not only enriches the lives of the immigrants but also the local populace, offering a panoramic view of diverse cultures. A shining exemplar of this approach is New Zealand, a nation that stands as a testament to the peaceful coexistence of myriad cultures. By fostering such an environment, nations not only combat cultural discrimination but also fortify social cohesion. Hence, in the grand tapestry of our globalized world, promoting cultural integration is undeniably pragmatic. In conclusion, while immigrants immersing themselves in the national lifestyle of their new home ensures deeper cultural understanding and easier integration, a society that celebrates the confluence of diverse cultures promises understanding and harmony. As the world draws closer, the path of cultural amalgamation seems not only desirable but essential.

You’d be surprised what forensics experts can already do, says Clare Wilson. At present, if police find DNA which could be that of the criminal at the scene of a crime (for example in blood or hair), standard forensic techniques can help in two ways. If there’s a suspect in custody, the police can see if their DNA matches the “crime stain”, as it is called. Or in the absence of a suspect, they can see if it matches the DNA of any known criminal held in their archives. Both techniques have proved their worth in criminal investigations. But what if there’s no suspect and no match in the archive? Even since DNA testing was introduced, forensic scientists have wondered how much a DNA sample on its own could tell them about what a criminal might look like. Scientists have already had some success with predicting hair color from DNA samples. For example, researchers at Britain’s Forensic Science Service (FSS) have developed a DNA test which will tell with 98% accuracy whether or not someone has red hair. However, the red-hair test is of limited use in Britain, where only 6% of the population are red-haired. What about blonde, brown and black-haired criminals? Hair color is usually determined by the cumulative effect of several genes, so unfortunately there’s no such thing as a single gene for blonde hair that could be turned into a simple test, for example. It’s the same with eye color. But biotechnology firm DNA Print Genomics of Florida, USA, is having a crack at both problems. As a starting point, research was carried out using mice to discover the genes that controlled eye color. Similar sequences in human DNA were then investigated, and ten possible genes were found. Next, the DNA Print researchers took DNA samples from 500 volunteers and recorded their eye colors. They then applied a technique called SNP mapping to see if they could discover any correlations between the two. (SNP stands for ‘single nucleotide polymorphism’ — a single ‘letter’ change in the genetic code. These variations account for most of the genetic differences between individuals.) The researchers sequenced the ten possible genes from each volunteer, then sifted through the sequences looking for SNPs. They found 50 in total. Then they set computers to work out how the SNPs correlated with eye color. Of the ten genes, they found that only four really matter. By looking at these, they can classify someone as having dark eyes (blue and grey), or hazel eyes (greenish-brown) — with 97% certainty. DNA Print is now applying exactly the same technique to hair color, identifying possible genes and looking for SNPs. Representatives say they have made some headway and can classify people into one of three groups — blonde, brown or black-haired- with some accuracy, from their DNA alone. Back in Britain, the Forensic Science Service has also been pursuing the genetic basis of facial features. A few years ago it helped fund a major project carried out by scientists at University College London (UCL). Over several months, an exhibit at a London museum invited visitors to leave DNA samples and have their faces scanned using 3D surface mapping. About 600 people volunteered. The UCL researchers tried to break down this data on overall facial nose curvature or chin clefts, and correlate them to DNA sequences. But they made little progress. Just as with eye color, there is no one gene for a big nose, so the enormous complexity of the task defeated the researchers. When the lead scientists retired, the project was wound down without drawing any firm conclusions. But the idea of finding genes for facial features isn’t dead. Many of the genes involved are common to most mammals. So a gene for a large jaw in mice, for example, might very well be found in humans, too. One promising project has found that mice show significant variation in jaw shape and size, and has begun to unravel the genetic","date":"2023-08-07","objectID":"/getting-the-picture-from-dna/:0:0","tags":["forensic","dna","ielts"],"title":"Getting the Picture From DNA","uri":"/getting-the-picture-from-dna/"},{"categories":["essay"],"content":"Climate change, a pressing global issue, has captured the world's attention due to its escalating impact on our daily lives. Rising temperatures, increased severity and frequency of natural disasters, and depleting natural resources are among the serious consequences of this worldwide phenomenon. However, scientists and policymakers have shown that sustainable practices can mitigate these effects and ensure the well-being of future generations. The overconsumption of natural resources is one of the most critical environmental issues of the 21st century. To meet the demand of the growing population, societies are exploiting the Earth’s resources at an unprecedented rate, which is not only depleting these resources but also generating waste and pollution. For instance, the plastics that litter our oceans and landscapes are a visual testament to our rampant consumption and waste generation. Sustainable practices are the solution to this daunting problem. Sustainability means utilizing resources in a manner that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves the efficient use of resources, reducing waste, recycling, and promoting renewable energy. In the energy sector, the transition from non-renewable fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is a prime example of sustainability. It is also becoming increasingly feasible with technological advances. These alternative energy sources are not only renewable but also less damaging to the environment as they release fewer greenhouse gases. At an individual level, every citizen has a role to play. Simple practices like reducing, reusing, and recycling can have a significant impact. Reducing personal consumption, reusing items instead of discarding them, and recycling waste all contribute to sustainability. Moreover, adopting a plant-based diet or reducing meat consumption can significantly lower carbon emissions, as animal agriculture is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases. The corporate sector has a vital role in promoting sustainability. Companies should adopt eco-friendly practices, such as minimizing waste production, recycling, and sourcing raw materials sustainably. Additionally, companies can prioritize research and development into green technologies, which could revolutionize industries and contribute to a more sustainable future. To ensure these practices are adopted, governments worldwide must implement and enforce stringent regulations on resource use and waste generation. They must also support and incentivize renewable energy development, which can help accelerate the shift towards a sustainable society. In conclusion, the adoption of sustainable practices is no longer optional – it is a necessity for our survival. Each of us, from individual citizens to governments, has a role to play in creating a sustainable future. Only through combined efforts can we hope to address the pressing issue of climate change and protect our planet for generations to come.

We’re facing hotter temperatures, more frequent and devastating natural disasters, and a rapid depletion of our planet’s resources. However, experts in the field have proposed that by adopting eco-friendly habits, we could reduce these effects and safeguard the planet for future generations. One of the biggest threats to our environment in this era is the excessive use of natural resources. As the population continues to expand, we’re using the Earth’s resources at an unsustainable rate. This leads to exhaustion of these resources, along with increasing pollution and waste. The plastic waste that is common in our oceans and across our landscapes is a stark reminder of our society’s consumption habits. The answer to this worrying issue lies in sustainable living. This means using resources in such a way that we can meet our current needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes making efficient use of resources, minimizing waste, recycling, and switching to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is a perfect example of sustainable living, especially as we transition away from non-renewable fossil fuels like coal and oil to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power. Thanks to advancements in technology, this transition is becoming more achievable. Renewable energy sources are not only inexhaustible but are also less harmful to the environment as they emit fewer greenhouse gases. Every person has a part to play in this process. We can all contribute by following the three Rs: reducing, reusing, and recycling. By consuming less, re-purposing items, and recycling waste, we’re participating in sustainable living. Furthermore, we can lower carbon emissions by adopting a diet that is plant-based or contains less meat, as livestock farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Companies also have an important role to play in sustainability. They should aim to reduce waste, recycle, and use sustainable materials. In addition, they should invest in research and development of green technologies, which could lead to industry transformations and a more sustainable future. Governments around the world must ensure that these sustainable practices are adopted by implementing and enforcing strict rules regarding the use of resources and the generation of waste. They should also support and offer incentives for the development of renewable energy, which could hasten the transition to a sustainable society. In conclusion, adopting eco-friendly habits is not just a choice anymore; it’s a requirement for our survival. Everyone, from individuals to governments, needs to play their part in achieving a sustainable future. It’s only through collective efforts that we can hope to tackle the urgent issue of climate change and preserve our planet for future generations.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, exacerbating health inequities and affecting the social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. The direct damage caused by climate change-related extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms is apparent, resulting in immediate loss of life, injury, and displacement. However, the indirect effects are equally, if not more, consequential. Increased heat intensity contributes to cardiovascular failure, while the rise in temperatures aids in the proliferation of disease vectors, increasing the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Changes in climate also affect patterns of infection. With warmer conditions, disease vectors can survive in regions where they previously couldn’t, resulting in the geographic spread of diseases. The expanding range of the mosquito vector, for example, has led to an increase in vector-borne diseases in areas previously untouched. Moreover, climate change exacerbates air pollution, a silent killer responsible for millions of deaths annually. Rising temperatures amplify the production of allergens and air pollutants that worsen respiratory conditions such as asthma and contribute to other illnesses including stroke, heart disease, and lung cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress alone. The threat to food security posed by climate change is another major concern. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns disrupt agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and malnutrition, particularly in regions already grappling with food security issues. Malnutrition, especially during early childhood, can have long-lasting effects on health, impacting physical and cognitive development. It’s important to note that the health impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, the economically disadvantaged, and those with pre-existing health conditions. These groups are often the least equipped to adapt to such changes, which further exacerbates global health disparities. Addressing climate change and global health simultaneously requires multisectoral action. This includes shifting towards renewable energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating resilient health systems, and implementing policies to protect the most vulnerable populations. In fact, many of the interventions to combat climate change could have immediate health benefits. For instance, promoting active transport and plant-based diets could reduce non-communicable diseases, while cleaner energy sources could lower respiratory disease rates. To conclude, the health of humanity is deeply tied to the health of our planet. Climate change and global health are inextricably linked, and our response should reflect this interconnectedness. It is incumbent on us to advocate for sustainable practices and policies that not only mitigate climate change but also pave the way for a healthier global community. This includes investment in climate research, prioritization of sustainable practices in industry, and individual action to reduce our carbon footprint. By acknowledging and addressing this link, we can safeguard our environment and promote global health, creating a sustainable future for generations to come.

The Earth was wrestling with the brunt of extreme weather conditions; forest fires in the west, blizzards in the east, and unpredictable cyclones in the southern hemisphere were becoming commonplace. The planet was at a critical crossroads, and its inhabitants knew they needed to act swiftly to avert irreversible catastrophe. Amidst this chaos, a young woman named Lea lived in a city choked by smog and dominated by waste. While others succumbed to despair, Lea was undeterred. She had always been captivated by the idea of clean energy, especially solar power. She was an electrical engineer, and she knew that if she could harness the power of the sun effectively, she could play a significant role in reducing the world’s carbon emissions. One day, while rummaging through piles of recyclable waste, she found a damaged, discarded solar panel. An idea sparked in her mind. She brought it back to her small workshop, repaired it, and began experimenting with it. After months of relentless work, she made a breakthrough. She developed a revolutionary technology to maximize the efficiency of solar panels and minimize the waste during their manufacturing process. She named it “Solara.” With Solara, one could produce electricity not just more efficiently but also in a way that considerably reduced the carbon footprint of the production process. The news about Solara spread rapidly, even in a world preoccupied with the daily fight for survival. Environmentalists and clean energy proponents lauded Lea’s innovation. She became a beacon of hope in a world teetering on the brink of environmental destruction. But the fossil fuel industry, which had deep pockets and wielded substantial influence, wasn’t going to relinquish its dominance without a fight. They launched a campaign to discredit Lea’s technology, asserting that it was unrealistic and impractical. Lea, however, wasn’t deterred. She knew that the future of the planet hinged on the success of Solara. She conducted public demonstrations of her technology in cities around the world. She showed how a small solar panel, using her technology, could provide electricity for an entire neighborhood. The demonstrations were a success. The public, long suffering from power shortages and the repercussions of extreme weather events, embraced Solara. Pressure began to mount on governments to invest in Lea’s clean energy technology. The tide began to turn against the fossil fuel industry, and governments around the world started investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure. As solar power became the world’s dominant energy source, carbon emissions decreased dramatically. The extreme weather events began to lessen in frequency and intensity. Forest fires, once a terrifyingly regular event, became less common. The world started to breathe again, and the grim shadow of imminent catastrophe began to recede. The world learned a critical lesson: the health of our planet and our survival depended on clean energy, recycling, and waste reduction. Lea’s perseverance and ingenuity had shown humanity the way, transforming the world for the better and giving it a new lease on life. And amidst it all, Solara shone, a symbol of hope and a testament to the power of clean, sustainable energy.

On an ordinary afternoon, I sit by the window, soaking up the warm sunlight. Time passes slowly, and the dusty, age-old memories that have been collecting in a corner of my mind start to wake up from their slumber. In this unexpected moment of leisure, coffee is an inevitable thought. Even in the seemingly simple act of boiling water, happiness seeps in. Watching the hot water slowly start to boil, I temporarily put down the weight of my future concerns. The sight of the green trees and terraced houses outside my window provides a soothing embrace. At that moment, the neighbor’s cat comes out for a stroll. She, as always, finds her way onto my deck, surveying her surroundings with eyes full of curiosity. ‘Perhaps, she too is enjoying this leisure time just like me?’ I ponder as I watch her. During these tranquil moments as they pass by, I discover the quiet beauty of everyday life. Like the aroma of coffee, a simple yet serene happiness fills my heart. Savoring this scent, I slowly lift my cup of coffee.

How do you send money without a bank account or the internet? Some countries have various options, including PayPal, online banking, or money orders. However, many people in rural communities don’t have access to basic banking services such as direct debit. There are two billion 'unbanked' adults in developing countries that cannot make transactions or transfer money. Their credit cards are unstable because they have no way to save for the future. Giving people access to banking is called 'financial inclusion'. By lowering the cost of transactions, financial inclusion encourages economic growth. Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. It is easy to use, has low fees, and doesn’t involve credit cards. All you need is an old mobile phone, and money is sent via text messages. Most customers use it for person-to-person (P2P) payments, but some use it to pay utility bills. Useful Expressions Financial inclusion: This term refers to the process of providing access to basic financial services, such as banking and payment systems, to individuals who are traditionally excluded from such services. It aims to bridge the gap between individuals and the formal financial system, enabling them to save, make transactions, and access other financial services. The expression “financial inclusion” emphasizes the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to affordable and convenient financial services. ‘Unbanked’ adults: This phrase refers to individuals who do not have access to or do not use formal banking services. They lack bank accounts and rely on alternative methods for financial transactions and money management. The term “unbanked” highlights the lack of financial inclusion for these individuals and the challenges they face in participating in the formal financial system. Mobile banking: Mobile banking refers to the use of mobile phones or other mobile devices to conduct financial transactions and access financial services. In the context of the article, it is mentioned that Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. This expression underscores the role of mobile technology in expanding financial inclusion, particularly in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Person-to-person (P2P) payments: P2P payments refer to transactions where funds are transferred directly from one individual to another, typically using electronic or mobile payment systems. In the article, it is mentioned that most customers in Kenya use mobile banking for P2P payments. This expression highlights the common use of mobile banking for person-to-person financial transactions, enabling individuals to send and receive money conveniently and securely. Utility bills: Utility bills are invoices or statements that represent charges for essential services such as electricity, water, or gas. In the article, it is mentioned that some customers in Kenya use mobile banking to pay their utility bills. This expression emphasizes the use of mobile banking as a convenient and accessible method for individuals to settle their utility expenses. Traditional banking services: Traditional banking services are the conventional methods and offerings provided by banks, such as physical branches, ATMs, and face-to-face interactions. In the article, it mentions that many people in rural communities lack access to basic banking services, including traditional banking facilities. This expression emphasizes the need for alternative solutions in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited.

The ideal candidate must “exude kindness”. As a rule, I would say that if you are actually sweating a quality, you are probably trying too hard. Nobody thinks “he oozes niceness” is a compliment. The requirement does, however, raise an interesting question: at work, how much kindness is enough, and how much is too much? It is a cruel world. Harshness is the tenor of much dialogue, from the US president down. Simple kindness may well make the difference between contentment and misery. That is the attitude Kind Snacks is out to promote. Its mission is to “make the world a little kinder”. Its website positively drips with benevolence. Kind has set up a Kind Foundation, fostering “kinder and more empathetic communities”; it hands out #kindawesome cards when it sees someone being kind; it offers tips about how to be kind every day. Last week, Mars bought a minority stake and is ready to push Kind’s sticky bars and their somewhat cloying message into even more countries. Much of Kind’s activity is marketing — the token of Kind’s appreciation for acts of kindness is a free snack — and some approaches the border of creepiness. This was the week Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with Garrison Keillor, whose Lake Wobegon is a fictional archetype of a kind, compassionate community, while it looked into allegations of “inappropriate behaviour”. It may not be the moment to “drop a loving note into a friend’s bag for them to discover later” — one of Kind’s tips — unless you know that friend very well, or don’t mind if your human resources Swat team pays you an urgent visit. Yet there is a kernel of truth behind the flummery. Kind makes a useful distinction between mere niceness, which is passive, and active kindness. Its founder Daniel Lubetzky was inspired by his father’s tale of how he survived Dachau, in part because of the unexpected kindness of a concentration camp guard, who broke the rules to give him a rotten potato. What is more, research confirms workplace warmheartedness has wider benefits. A University of California study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behaviour — “paying it forward” — while givers and receivers felt a greater sense of autonomy, and were happier all around. Another study in the Academy of Management Journal highlighted the importance of “companionate love” in the male-dominated world of firefighting. When combined with a culture of “joviality”, acts of kindness — such as raising money to help a financially troubled colleague hang on to his house — moderated risk-taking and reduced health problems triggered by the strain of balancing work and family. As in so many other areas, though, kindness gets more complicated as people climb the corporate hierarchy. I suggested to some chief executives that one risk of including “decency” in your corporate values was that staff might consider you had broken your promise if you had to sack them. One promptly fired back, to widespread nodding, that a far graver breach would be to keep staff on at the expense of the company’s long-term health. Companies are occasionally killed by kindness. The owner of Malden Mills, a Massachusetts textile company, rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire in 1995, instead of offshoring production. His benevolence backfired. He misread the global market and plunged everybody into bankruptcy. It was “a cautionary tale about adventures in the frontier” of efforts to make the world a better place, wrote academic Roger Martin. Similarly, Etsy, the crafts market operating on the same frontier, has had to toughen its sensitive side and ditch its folksy chief executive to survive as a listed company. “Being good does","date":"2023-06-28","objectID":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/:0:0","tags":["Andrew Hill","business","FT","english","cleft sentence"],"title":"Why It Can Be Cruel to Be Kind in the Workplace","uri":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/"},{"categories":["article"],"content":"Killed by Kindness This phrase is used to denote a situation where one’s good intentions or excessive generosity lead to negative outcomes.
