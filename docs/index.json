His research instrument of choice was questionnaires, which he meticulously designed to collect data for his study. Albert’s passion lay in the most barren and isolated corners of our planet, and so, his study focused on Antarctica, the driest continent on Earth. To most, Antarctica was a vast, white wilderness, but to Albert, it was an unexplored world of scientific wonders waiting to be discovered. In his research, Albert wanted to delve into how the minimal amount of precipitation in Antarctica evaporates, and how this process influences the overall climate of the continent. He was particularly interested in how the rare moisture penetrates the icy surface and seeps down into the soil beneath. But Albert had a greater vision. He dreamed of harnessing the hydro-electric power hidden in Antarctica’s icy depths. He believed that the driest continent could someday be a source of renewable energy. The questionnaires he sent to other scientists around the world came back filled with diverse opinions and a wealth of information that fueled his research. Each day, he grew closer to completing his dissertation, and each day, his dream of unlocking Antarctica’s potential seemed more tangible. Albert’s story is a testament to the power of curiosity, persistence, and vision. It serves as a reminder that even the driest, most desolate places can hold unexpected possibilities.

Turning to the car, it was depicted as an exponential increase, beginning at 5% and reaching 35%. (161 words) Revised version of YouChat The bar chart provides data on the percentages of different modes of commuting in a European city over four decades, from 1950 to 1990. The modes of commuting considered are walking, cycling, bus, and car. The most striking trend is the major shift from more eco-friendly modes of commuting, such as walking and cycling, to car use by the end of the period. In 1950, the majority of commuters walked to work, accounting for 35% of the total. However, by 1990, this had dramatically fallen to just 5%. Similarly, commuting by bus also saw a significant drop from 30% in 1950 to 5% in 1990. On the other hand, the use of bicycles for commuting experienced only slight fluctuations, starting at 20% in 1950, peaking at 25% in the middle of the period, and then falling to 15% by 1990. Car use, on the other hand, showed remarkable growth over the period, starting at a mere 5% in 1950 and shooting up to 35% by 1990. In conclusion, while walking and bus use as commuting options reduced drastically over the period, the use of cars surged, becoming the primary mode of commuting by 1990.

How often do you check your mail? I check my mail multiple times a day, especially during work hours. I like to stay updated with any important messages or updates. I usually check my email once in the morning and once in the evening. I find that this routine helps me manage my time better without being constantly distracted by incoming emails. 2. Do you think writing emails has strengthened or weakened people’s writing skills? I believe writing emails has both strengthened and weakened people’s writing skills. On one hand, people are writing more often because of emails, but on the other hand, the informal nature of emails has led some to neglect proper grammar and structure. Writing emails has definitely strengthened people’s writing skills, especially in a professional setting. It’s essential to be clear and concise in emails, and this practice can improve overall writing ability. 3. What are some of the disadvantages of e-mails? Some disadvantages of emails include the potential for miscommunication, as tone can be hard to convey, and the risk of important messages getting lost in a crowded inbox or going to the spam folder. Emails can sometimes be impersonal and lack the human touch that face-to-face communication or even a phone call can provide. Plus, there’s always the risk of security breaches and phishing scams. 4. Do you send and receive emails regularly? Yes, I send and receive emails regularly, especially for work. It’s one of my primary means of communication with colleagues and clients. I do receive emails regularly, mostly newsletters and updates, but I tend to use messaging apps more frequently for personal communication. 5. Do you think sending emails will be more or less popular in the future? I think emails will remain popular in the professional world because of their formal nature and record-keeping ability. However, for personal communication, instant messaging apps might overshadow emails. While the use of messaging apps is on the rise, emails will always have a place, especially in the business world. They offer a structured way to communicate, share documents, and maintain a record of conversations. Photographs 1. Do you prefer to send postcards to people or to send photos that you took yourself?

Yes, I’ve framed several photos from my travels and special moments with family. They serve as a reminder of good times and add a personal touch to my home. I haven’t framed many, but I do have a collage wall with photos from various phases of my life. It’s a visual journey every time I look at it. 3. Are there any photos on the walls of your house? Absolutely! I have a few family portraits and some landscape photos I’ve taken on trips hanging on my walls. They bring warmth and memories into my living space. Not many. I prefer keeping my walls minimalistic, but I do have a digital photo frame that rotates through my favorite photos. 4. Do you keep your photographs on your computer? Yes, I store most of my photographs on my computer. I also make sure to back them up on an external hard drive and cloud storage to ensure they’re safe. I used to, but now I primarily use cloud services. It allows me to access my photos from any device and ensures they’re safe from potential computer crashes. 5. How do you keep your photos? I organize my photos in folders by year and event on my computer. It makes it easier to find specific memories when I want to look back. I use a combination of physical albums for special occasions and digital storage for everyday photos. Having physical albums is nostalgic, and it’s always fun to flip through them with friends and family.

Overall, heart disease and ‘other’ were the root causes of death throughout the survey, while lung disease showed the least. To begin with, in 1975, a substantial proportion of 38% was seen in heart diseases, and that of ‘other’ was 4% less than heart diseases. This was followed by cancer, which was half that of ‘other’. Following that, accident, pneumonia, and lung disease illustrated a marginal difference, which ranged between 6% and 2% in order. Turning to 2002, the category of ‘other’ showed an increasing trend, and it had a considerable percentage of 35%. A similar trend was illustrated in cancer, which had slightly less than a quarter at 23%. As for pneumonia and lung disease, they presented a proportional pattern to cancer, as the former had 4% while the latter was depicted at 3%. In terms of heart disease and accident, they presented an inversely proportional tendency shown as 31% and 4%, respectively. (178 words) Feedback from ChatGPT The report does a commendable job at providing a structured and concise analysis of the differences in causes of death for the two years. Here are some observations and suggestions: Strengths: Clear Introduction: The introduction effectively sets the context by mentioning what the pie charts display and the years in which the surveys were conducted. Use of Comparative Language: The report uses comparative language like “a substantial proportion,” “half that of,” and “marginal difference” which aids in understanding the data more intuitively. Logical Structure: The data is structured logically, first discussing 1975 and then 2002, which makes it easy to follow. Areas for Improvement: Specific Data Points: It might be helpful to have specific data points for all categories, especially for 1975 where there’s a mention of a “marginal difference” between accident, pneumonia, and lung disease, but exact percentages are given only for lung disease. Consistency in Descriptions: While the description for 1975 uses terms like “substantial proportion” and “half that of,” the 2002 description is more direct with percentages. It might be more effective to maintain a consistent style throughout. Clarification on Trends: The statement “Turning to 2002, the category of ‘other’ showed an increasing trend” implies a comparison with 1975, but the 1975 value for ‘other’ isn’t explicitly mentioned before this. So, readers might have to backtrack to understand the trend. Minor Stylistic Points: The phrase “root causes of death” might be more accurately described as “leading causes of death.” Instead of “this survey was conducted,” it might be more direct to say “data is from 1975 and 2002.” Overall, the report does a good job at providing an overview of the data from the charts. With a few refinements, it could be even more effective in conveying the information clearly and concisely. Paraphrased Version by ChatGPT (152 words) The pie charts illustrate the distribution of six primary causes of death in the USA for the years 1975 and 2002. Overall, heart disease and the ‘other’ category dominated as leading causes of mortality during these years, with lung disease accounting for the smallest portion. In 1975, heart diseases took the lead, making up 38% of the deaths, closely followed by the ‘other’ category at 4% less. Cancer was the next significant cause, standing at half the percentage of the ‘other’ category. Deaths due to accidents, pneumonia, and lung disease were relatively close, with percentages spanning from 2% to 6%. By 2002, there was a noticeable rise in the ‘other’ category, reaching 35%. Cancer also saw an uptick, accounting for 23% of the deaths. Pneumonia and lung disease mirrored each other in proportions, with 4% and 3% respectively. Heart disease, though still significant, reduced to 31%, whereas accidents remained consistent at 4%.

Considering this situation, in my opinion, it is a positive development in terms of convenience and affordability. To begin with, the use of online medical advice is on the rise as it is a practical approach. This is a time-saving and cost-effective approach due to the fact that people can access medical information and advice for a diverse range of conditions more easily. For example, first-aid information for less serious conditions will not require a doctor to assess the condition. This way of treatment leads to a feasible approach for mild or minor conditions, resulting in reducing the influx of patients with minor conditions at hospitals. Therefore, seeking online medical advice is an effective and pragmatic approach in this modern era. On the other hand, using online medical advice may not be a good development, as there are drawbacks. The credibility of these online medical advice sites is unknown. Besides that, although some incurable or chronic diseases may require professional expertise and periodic assessment by doctors, they can be unable to state the exact symptoms of their condition and may be given the wrong advice. This leads to inappropriately self-medicating, and consequently, the use of online medical advice may have an adverse effect on people. In conclusion, online medical advice is a suitable approach for minor conditions, even though there is a possibility for this advice to be wrongly used. In my opinion, this is a positive development if it is treated with caution.

They are forgetting their history and traditions. More people should be encouraged to wear their traditional clothes every day. Do you agree or disagree?” 1. Introduction Background: With modernisation, the use of traditional clothes is becoming more and more uncommon. Introduce Question: Some are of the opinion that wearing traditional clothes on a daily basis should be fostered, while others differ in opinion. Focus: Considering this situation, I strongly agree with the idea of encouraging people to wear the traditional costume of their country on a daily basis. 2. Paragraph 2 Topic Sentence/Explanation: To begin with, wearing traditional clothes every day has its merits as it is a symbol of cultural identity. Supporting Information/Example or Situation: These clothes portray the sentiments of the indigenous culture and encompass traditional art. They act as a gateway to understanding indigenous culture. Furthermore, wearing these clothes fosters the spirit of patriotism, giving people a sense of belonging. Mini Closing: Therefore, wearing these costumes daily will have a significant contribution to strengthening the cultural roots of the citizens. 3. Paragraph 3 Topic Sentence/Explanation: On the other hand, wearing these clothes every day may not be a feasible approach. Supporting Information/Example or Situation: Many traditional clothes are cumbersome. Besides, they can be prohibitively expensive for some members of society. Wearing them every day might also deprive individuals of trying other types of clothes. In this internationalised global village, such a practice might be viewed as ethnocentric behaviour. Mini Closing: Hence, wearing these clothes daily may not be a pragmatic approach in today’s globalised society. 4. Conclusion Summarise 2nd Paragraph: It is apparent that wearing traditional costumes daily has benefits in strengthening cultural identity. Summarise 3rd Paragraph: But, by no means should we turn a blind eye to the fact that wearing them every day is not a suitable practice. Give Opinion: Nevertheless, I strongly agree that wearing traditional clothes every day will keep cultural values alive. Agreement Introduction: In the wake of modernization, the decline in the use of traditional garments has become more apparent. While some argue against it, I strongly support the idea of encouraging individuals to wear their country’s traditional costume on a daily basis. This essay will discuss the merits of embracing traditional attire as a symbol of cultural identity and how it contributes to strengthening cultural roots, despite the challenges it may present. Paragraph 2: To begin with, wearing traditional clothes every day holds great significance as it serves as a symbol of cultural identity. These garments encapsulate the sentiments of indigenous culture and embody traditional art forms. By donning traditional attire, individuals become walking ambassadors of their cultural heritage, providing a gateway for others to gain a deeper understanding of indigenous traditions. Moreover, this practice fosters a sense of patriotism, instilling in people a feeling of belonging and pride in their cultural roots. Paragraph 3: However, it is important to acknowledge that wearing traditional clothes every day may not be a feasible approach for everyone. Many traditional garments are intricate and cumbersome, making them impractical for daily wear. Additionally, the cost associated with acquiring these garments can be prohibitive for some members of society. It is also worth considering that limiting oneself to traditional attire may deprive individuals of the opportunity to explore and embrace other types of clothing. In today’s internationalized global village, such a practice might be perceived as ethnocentric behavior.

Wrting Example Introduction: The line graph displays the correlation between the energy demand and the availability from fossil fuels in Freedonia over a span of five decades, from 1980 to 2029. This study utilized energy units for representation. Overall: It is discernible that energy consumption remained relatively consistent between 1982 and 2009. However, post-2009, the consumption pattern depicts an overutilization of available energy resources. Paragraph 2: To begin with, the energy available from fossil fuels commenced at 5 units in 1980. This was followed by a substantial ascent, reaching 6.5 units by the year 2000. Following that, there was a precipitous decline, plummeting to a mere 2.5 units in 2010. Interestingly, from 2010 onwards, the energy availability appeared to plateau, showing little to no variation. Turning to the energy demand, it started at 3.5 units in 1980, experienced a dip towards 1990, remained stable around 2000, and is projected to increase exponentially to 7.0 units by 2020. Conclusion: In terms of the survey's findings, energy consumption exhibited stability between 1980 and 2010. However, post-2010, despite a constant energy availability, the demand for energy has shown a sharp incline. This trend underscores the growing energy needs of Freedonia and the potential challenges in meeting those demands in the future. Another One Introduction: The line graph illustrates the relationship between the demand for energy and the energy supply from fossil fuels in Freedonia across five decades, stretching from 1980 to 2029. Energy is quantified in specific units for this analysis. Overall: From a broad perspective, there was a stable trend in energy consumption from around 1982 to 2009. Yet, in the subsequent years after 2009, the graph demonstrates an apparent overuse of the energy available. Paragraph 2: Initially, the energy sourced from fossil fuels was recorded at 5 units in 1980. This number increased dramatically to 6.5 units by 2000. However, in the ensuing 10 years, there was a sharp decline, with numbers decreasing precipitously to 2.5 units by 2010. From this point, energy availability seemed to stabilize, with no significant changes noted. In terms of energy demand, it began at 3.5 units in 1980, saw a decline approaching 1990, showed stability around 2000, and is anticipated to rise exponentially, reaching 7.0 units by 2029. Conclusion: Reflecting on the data, the period between 1980 and 2010 showcased a consistent energy consumption pattern. However, post-2010, even with a stable energy supply, the demand for energy has surged. This upward trend highlights Freedonia’s escalating energy requirements and the imminent challenges in catering to such demands in upcoming years.

This interconnectedness, referred to as globalisation, is blurring the lines between distinct cultures, leading many to fear the eventual dissolution of cultural identities. I concur with this perspective, believing that unchecked globalisation poses a significant threat to the preservation of unique cultural heritages. Body Paragraph 1: Homogenization of Cultures At the forefront of the consequences of globalisation is the homogenization of cultures. As global brands dominate markets and Western entertainment becomes ubiquitous, local traditions and customs are often overshadowed. The ubiquity of global franchises, from fast food chains to clothing brands, means that cities across the world are beginning to look strikingly similar. Consequently, the rich tapestry of diverse cultural practices is at risk of being replaced by a monolithic global culture. Body Paragraph 2: Language Extinction Another alarming consequence of globalisation is the extinction of languages. As English becomes the de facto language of business, education, and the internet, many indigenous languages are dwindling, with some on the brink of extinction. With the loss of a language comes the loss of a unique worldview, folklore, and cultural practices, leading to an immeasurable cultural impoverishment. Conclusion In conclusion, while globalisation brings with it numerous benefits, including economic growth and increased access to information, its unchecked progression threatens the rich mosaic of world cultures. It is imperative that as we embrace globalisation, we also find ways to protect and preserve the myriad of cultural identities that make our world so beautifully diverse.

Body Paragraph 1: Amplification of Local Cultures Rather than eradicating local cultures, globalisation often serves as a platform for their amplification. Local artists, musicians, and craftsmen now have global audiences at their fingertips, thanks to the internet and social media. This global exposure not only provides economic benefits but also fosters a deeper appreciation and understanding of diverse cultures. Festivals, cuisines, and traditions that were once limited to specific regions are now celebrated and enjoyed worldwide. Body Paragraph 2: Cross-cultural Collaborations Globalisation has facilitated unprecedented levels of cross-cultural collaborations. Musicians from different parts of the world collaborate to produce fusion genres, chefs experiment with cross-cultural cuisines, and filmmakers weave stories that transcend national boundaries. These collaborations not only enrich the global cultural tapestry but also ensure that individual cultures evolve while retaining their core essence. Conclusion In sum, globalisation doesn’t necessarily spell the end of cultural identities. Instead, with the right mindset and approach, it can be leveraged to promote, preserve, and evolve these identities in the global arena. As societies become more interconnected, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that the world’s diverse cultures are celebrated and cherished.

The purpose of these surveys is to discern patterns and correlations between temperature and precipitation over the course of a year. The units of measurement are degrees Celsius for temperature and centimetres for rainfall. The data has been collected from the Dubai Meteorological Department. Overall, there is a noticeable correlation between the annual temperature and rainfall in Dubai. Specifically, the warmer months tend to have less rainfall, emphasising that the hotter months are typically drier. To begin with, in the months of January and February, the minimum temperature was recorded at 14°C and the maximum at 25°C. Following that, in March and April, there was an uptick in both minimum and maximum temperatures, recorded at 17°C and 32°C, respectively. In terms of the trend, the temperature consistently rose as the months progressed. By July and August, the minimum temperature reached its peak at 29°C, while the maximum soared to a sweltering 48°C. With regard to the maximum temperature, it demonstrated a consistent increase from January, peaking in July-August, and then seeing a decline towards the end of the year. Turning to annual rainfall, January started with 14 cm. This figure surged, peaking at 32 cm in February. This was followed by a steep drop, with May registering no rainfall, a trend that persisted until October. In the ensuing months, notably after October, there was a sharp rise in precipitation, with December recording 16 cm.

Mini Closing: It’s a practical approach for immigrants to follow the national lifestyle. Paragraph 3: Topic Sentence: The benefits of both immigrants and locals accepting different cultures. Explanation/Supporting Information: Healthy exchange of cultural ideas, broadening horizons, understanding various cultures, reducing cultural discrimination, maintaining social cohesion. Example: New Zealand respects cultural diversity and has a coexistence of different cultures. Mini Closing: It’s pragmatic for both migrants and locals to integrate with diverse cultures. Conclusion: Summarise Paragraph 2: Immigrants adopting the national lifestyle will integrate well. Summarise Paragraph 3: Embracing diverse cultures creates better understanding and peace. An Example of an Essay As globalization surges forward, the act of migrating to foreign lands has become a common phenomenon. A debate arises: Should migrants adopt the national lifestyle of their new home, or should a harmonious blend of cultures be encouraged? This essay will explore both viewpoints. To begin with, there are undeniable merits to immigrants integrating into the national lifestyle of their host country. By doing so, they equip themselves with guidelines that aid their smooth transition into unfamiliar territories. It not only helps them avert potential misunderstandings stemming from ignorance but also serves as a profound gesture of respect towards the native culture. Adopting the national lifestyle narrows the cultural chasm, fostering a sense of belonging. In doing so, a harmonious atmosphere is birthed, where cultural disparities are minimized, and unity is promoted. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, embracing the national lifestyle seems to be a logical approach for immigrants. On the other hand, a society where both immigrants and locals recognize and appreciate varied cultures offers its own set of advantages. Such an environment paves the way for a vibrant exchange of cultural ideas, broadening the horizons of all inhabitants. This mutual understanding not only enriches the lives of the immigrants but also the local populace, offering a panoramic view of diverse cultures. A shining exemplar of this approach is New Zealand, a nation that stands as a testament to the peaceful coexistence of myriad cultures. By fostering such an environment, nations not only combat cultural discrimination but also fortify social cohesion. Hence, in the grand tapestry of our globalized world, promoting cultural integration is undeniably pragmatic. In conclusion, while immigrants immersing themselves in the national lifestyle of their new home ensures deeper cultural understanding and easier integration, a society that celebrates the confluence of diverse cultures promises understanding and harmony. As the world draws closer, the path of cultural amalgamation seems not only desirable but essential.

You’d be surprised what forensics experts can already do, says Clare Wilson. At present, if police find DNA which could be that of the criminal at the scene of a crime (for example in blood or hair), standard forensic techniques can help in two ways. If there’s a suspect in custody, the police can see if their DNA matches the “crime stain”, as it is called. Or in the absence of a suspect, they can see if it matches the DNA of any known criminal held in their archives. Both techniques have proved their worth in criminal investigations. But what if there’s no suspect and no match in the archive? Even since DNA testing was introduced, forensic scientists have wondered how much a DNA sample on its own could tell them about what a criminal might look like. Scientists have already had some success with predicting hair color from DNA samples. For example, researchers at Britain’s Forensic Science Service (FSS) have developed a DNA test which will tell with 98% accuracy whether or not someone has red hair. However, the red-hair test is of limited use in Britain, where only 6% of the population are red-haired. What about blonde, brown and black-haired criminals? Hair color is usually determined by the cumulative effect of several genes, so unfortunately there’s no such thing as a single gene for blonde hair that could be turned into a simple test, for example. It’s the same with eye color. But biotechnology firm DNA Print Genomics of Florida, USA, is having a crack at both problems. As a starting point, research was carried out using mice to discover the genes that controlled eye color. Similar sequences in human DNA were then investigated, and ten possible genes were found. Next, the DNA Print researchers took DNA samples from 500 volunteers and recorded their eye colors. They then applied a technique called SNP mapping to see if they could discover any correlations between the two. (SNP stands for ‘single nucleotide polymorphism’ — a single ‘letter’ change in the genetic code. These variations account for most of the genetic differences between individuals.) The researchers sequenced the ten possible genes from each volunteer, then sifted through the sequences looking for SNPs. They found 50 in total. Then they set computers to work out how the SNPs correlated with eye color. Of the ten genes, they found that only four really matter. By looking at these, they can classify someone as having dark eyes (blue and grey), or hazel eyes (greenish-brown) — with 97% certainty. DNA Print is now applying exactly the same technique to hair color, identifying possible genes and looking for SNPs. Representatives say they have made some headway and can classify people into one of three groups — blonde, brown or black-haired- with some accuracy, from their DNA alone. Back in Britain, the Forensic Science Service has also been pursuing the genetic basis of facial features. A few years ago it helped fund a major project carried out by scientists at University College London (UCL). Over several months, an exhibit at a London museum invited visitors to leave DNA samples and have their faces scanned using 3D surface mapping. About 600 people volunteered. The UCL researchers tried to break down this data on overall facial nose curvature or chin clefts, and correlate them to DNA sequences. But they made little progress. Just as with eye color, there is no one gene for a big nose, so the enormous complexity of the task defeated the researchers. When the lead scientists retired, the project was wound down without drawing any firm conclusions. But the idea of finding genes for facial features isn’t dead. Many of the genes involved are common to most mammals. So a gene for a large jaw in mice, for example, might very well be found in humans, too. One promising project has found that mice show significant variation in jaw shape and size, and has begun to unravel the genetic","date":"2023-08-07","objectID":"/getting-the-picture-from-dna/:0:0","tags":["forensic","dna","ielts"],"title":"Getting the Picture From DNA","uri":"/getting-the-picture-from-dna/"},{"categories":["essay"],"content":"Climate change, a pressing global issue, has captured the world's attention due to its escalating impact on our daily lives. Rising temperatures, increased severity and frequency of natural disasters, and depleting natural resources are among the serious consequences of this worldwide phenomenon. However, scientists and policymakers have shown that sustainable practices can mitigate these effects and ensure the well-being of future generations. The overconsumption of natural resources is one of the most critical environmental issues of the 21st century. To meet the demand of the growing population, societies are exploiting the Earth’s resources at an unprecedented rate, which is not only depleting these resources but also generating waste and pollution. For instance, the plastics that litter our oceans and landscapes are a visual testament to our rampant consumption and waste generation. Sustainable practices are the solution to this daunting problem. Sustainability means utilizing resources in a manner that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves the efficient use of resources, reducing waste, recycling, and promoting renewable energy. In the energy sector, the transition from non-renewable fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is a prime example of sustainability. It is also becoming increasingly feasible with technological advances. These alternative energy sources are not only renewable but also less damaging to the environment as they release fewer greenhouse gases. At an individual level, every citizen has a role to play. Simple practices like reducing, reusing, and recycling can have a significant impact. Reducing personal consumption, reusing items instead of discarding them, and recycling waste all contribute to sustainability. Moreover, adopting a plant-based diet or reducing meat consumption can significantly lower carbon emissions, as animal agriculture is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases. The corporate sector has a vital role in promoting sustainability. Companies should adopt eco-friendly practices, such as minimizing waste production, recycling, and sourcing raw materials sustainably. Additionally, companies can prioritize research and development into green technologies, which could revolutionize industries and contribute to a more sustainable future. To ensure these practices are adopted, governments worldwide must implement and enforce stringent regulations on resource use and waste generation. They must also support and incentivize renewable energy development, which can help accelerate the shift towards a sustainable society. In conclusion, the adoption of sustainable practices is no longer optional – it is a necessity for our survival. Each of us, from individual citizens to governments, has a role to play in creating a sustainable future. Only through combined efforts can we hope to address the pressing issue of climate change and protect our planet for generations to come.

We’re facing hotter temperatures, more frequent and devastating natural disasters, and a rapid depletion of our planet’s resources. However, experts in the field have proposed that by adopting eco-friendly habits, we could reduce these effects and safeguard the planet for future generations. One of the biggest threats to our environment in this era is the excessive use of natural resources. As the population continues to expand, we’re using the Earth’s resources at an unsustainable rate. This leads to exhaustion of these resources, along with increasing pollution and waste. The plastic waste that is common in our oceans and across our landscapes is a stark reminder of our society’s consumption habits. The answer to this worrying issue lies in sustainable living. This means using resources in such a way that we can meet our current needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes making efficient use of resources, minimizing waste, recycling, and switching to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is a perfect example of sustainable living, especially as we transition away from non-renewable fossil fuels like coal and oil to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power. Thanks to advancements in technology, this transition is becoming more achievable. Renewable energy sources are not only inexhaustible but are also less harmful to the environment as they emit fewer greenhouse gases. Every person has a part to play in this process. We can all contribute by following the three Rs: reducing, reusing, and recycling. By consuming less, re-purposing items, and recycling waste, we’re participating in sustainable living. Furthermore, we can lower carbon emissions by adopting a diet that is plant-based or contains less meat, as livestock farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Companies also have an important role to play in sustainability. They should aim to reduce waste, recycle, and use sustainable materials. In addition, they should invest in research and development of green technologies, which could lead to industry transformations and a more sustainable future. Governments around the world must ensure that these sustainable practices are adopted by implementing and enforcing strict rules regarding the use of resources and the generation of waste. They should also support and offer incentives for the development of renewable energy, which could hasten the transition to a sustainable society. In conclusion, adopting eco-friendly habits is not just a choice anymore; it’s a requirement for our survival. Everyone, from individuals to governments, needs to play their part in achieving a sustainable future. It’s only through collective efforts that we can hope to tackle the urgent issue of climate change and preserve our planet for future generations.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, exacerbating health inequities and affecting the social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. The direct damage caused by climate change-related extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms is apparent, resulting in immediate loss of life, injury, and displacement. However, the indirect effects are equally, if not more, consequential. Increased heat intensity contributes to cardiovascular failure, while the rise in temperatures aids in the proliferation of disease vectors, increasing the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Changes in climate also affect patterns of infection. With warmer conditions, disease vectors can survive in regions where they previously couldn’t, resulting in the geographic spread of diseases. The expanding range of the mosquito vector, for example, has led to an increase in vector-borne diseases in areas previously untouched. Moreover, climate change exacerbates air pollution, a silent killer responsible for millions of deaths annually. Rising temperatures amplify the production of allergens and air pollutants that worsen respiratory conditions such as asthma and contribute to other illnesses including stroke, heart disease, and lung cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress alone. The threat to food security posed by climate change is another major concern. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns disrupt agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and malnutrition, particularly in regions already grappling with food security issues. Malnutrition, especially during early childhood, can have long-lasting effects on health, impacting physical and cognitive development. It’s important to note that the health impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, the economically disadvantaged, and those with pre-existing health conditions. These groups are often the least equipped to adapt to such changes, which further exacerbates global health disparities. Addressing climate change and global health simultaneously requires multisectoral action. This includes shifting towards renewable energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating resilient health systems, and implementing policies to protect the most vulnerable populations. In fact, many of the interventions to combat climate change could have immediate health benefits. For instance, promoting active transport and plant-based diets could reduce non-communicable diseases, while cleaner energy sources could lower respiratory disease rates. To conclude, the health of humanity is deeply tied to the health of our planet. Climate change and global health are inextricably linked, and our response should reflect this interconnectedness. It is incumbent on us to advocate for sustainable practices and policies that not only mitigate climate change but also pave the way for a healthier global community. This includes investment in climate research, prioritization of sustainable practices in industry, and individual action to reduce our carbon footprint. By acknowledging and addressing this link, we can safeguard our environment and promote global health, creating a sustainable future for generations to come.

She had always been captivated by the idea of clean energy, especially solar power. She was an electrical engineer, and she knew that if she could harness the power of the sun effectively, she could play a significant role in reducing the world’s carbon emissions. One day, while rummaging through piles of recyclable waste, she found a damaged, discarded solar panel. An idea sparked in her mind. She brought it back to her small workshop, repaired it, and began experimenting with it. After months of relentless work, she made a breakthrough. She developed a revolutionary technology to maximize the efficiency of solar panels and minimize the waste during their manufacturing process. She named it “Solara.” With Solara, one could produce electricity not just more efficiently but also in a way that considerably reduced the carbon footprint of the production process. The news about Solara spread rapidly, even in a world preoccupied with the daily fight for survival. Environmentalists and clean energy proponents lauded Lea’s innovation. She became a beacon of hope in a world teetering on the brink of environmental destruction. But the fossil fuel industry, which had deep pockets and wielded substantial influence, wasn’t going to relinquish its dominance without a fight. They launched a campaign to discredit Lea’s technology, asserting that it was unrealistic and impractical. Lea, however, wasn’t deterred. She knew that the future of the planet hinged on the success of Solara. She conducted public demonstrations of her technology in cities around the world. She showed how a small solar panel, using her technology, could provide electricity for an entire neighborhood. The demonstrations were a success. The public, long suffering from power shortages and the repercussions of extreme weather events, embraced Solara. Pressure began to mount on governments to invest in Lea’s clean energy technology. The tide began to turn against the fossil fuel industry, and governments around the world started investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure. As solar power became the world’s dominant energy source, carbon emissions decreased dramatically. The extreme weather events began to lessen in frequency and intensity. Forest fires, once a terrifyingly regular event, became less common. The world started to breathe again, and the grim shadow of imminent catastrophe began to recede. The world learned a critical lesson: the health of our planet and our survival depended on clean energy, recycling, and waste reduction. Lea’s perseverance and ingenuity had shown humanity the way, transforming the world for the better and giving it a new lease on life. And amidst it all, Solara shone, a symbol of hope and a testament to the power of clean, sustainable energy.

On an ordinary afternoon, I sit by the window, soaking up the warm sunlight. Time passes slowly, and the dusty, age-old memories that have been collecting in a corner of my mind start to wake up from their slumber. In this unexpected moment of leisure, coffee is an inevitable thought. Even in the seemingly simple act of boiling water, happiness seeps in. Watching the hot water slowly start to boil, I temporarily put down the weight of my future concerns. The sight of the green trees and terraced houses outside my window provides a soothing embrace. At that moment, the neighbor’s cat comes out for a stroll. She, as always, finds her way onto my deck, surveying her surroundings with eyes full of curiosity. ‘Perhaps, she too is enjoying this leisure time just like me?’ I ponder as I watch her. During these tranquil moments as they pass by, I discover the quiet beauty of everyday life. Like the aroma of coffee, a simple yet serene happiness fills my heart. Savoring this scent, I slowly lift my cup of coffee.

How do you send money without a bank account or the internet? Some countries have various options, including PayPal, online banking, or money orders. However, many people in rural communities don’t have access to basic banking services such as direct debit. There are two billion 'unbanked' adults in developing countries that cannot make transactions or transfer money. Their credit cards are unstable because they have no way to save for the future. Giving people access to banking is called 'financial inclusion'. By lowering the cost of transactions, financial inclusion encourages economic growth. Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. It is easy to use, has low fees, and doesn’t involve credit cards. All you need is an old mobile phone, and money is sent via text messages. Most customers use it for person-to-person (P2P) payments, but some use it to pay utility bills. Useful Expressions Financial inclusion: This term refers to the process of providing access to basic financial services, such as banking and payment systems, to individuals who are traditionally excluded from such services. It aims to bridge the gap between individuals and the formal financial system, enabling them to save, make transactions, and access other financial services. The expression “financial inclusion” emphasizes the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to affordable and convenient financial services. ‘Unbanked’ adults: This phrase refers to individuals who do not have access to or do not use formal banking services. They lack bank accounts and rely on alternative methods for financial transactions and money management. The term “unbanked” highlights the lack of financial inclusion for these individuals and the challenges they face in participating in the formal financial system. Mobile banking: Mobile banking refers to the use of mobile phones or other mobile devices to conduct financial transactions and access financial services. In the context of the article, it is mentioned that Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. This expression underscores the role of mobile technology in expanding financial inclusion, particularly in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Person-to-person (P2P) payments: P2P payments refer to transactions where funds are transferred directly from one individual to another, typically using electronic or mobile payment systems. In the article, it is mentioned that most customers in Kenya use mobile banking for P2P payments. This expression highlights the common use of mobile banking for person-to-person financial transactions, enabling individuals to send and receive money conveniently and securely. Utility bills: Utility bills are invoices or statements that represent charges for essential services such as electricity, water, or gas. In the article, it is mentioned that some customers in Kenya use mobile banking to pay their utility bills. This expression emphasizes the use of mobile banking as a convenient and accessible method for individuals to settle their utility expenses. Traditional banking services: Traditional banking services are the conventional methods and offerings provided by banks, such as physical branches, ATMs, and face-to-face interactions. In the article, it mentions that many people in rural communities lack access to basic banking services, including traditional banking facilities. This expression emphasizes the need for alternative solutions in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited.

The ideal candidate must “exude kindness”. As a rule, I would say that if you are actually sweating a quality, you are probably trying too hard. Nobody thinks “he oozes niceness” is a compliment. The requirement does, however, raise an interesting question: at work, how much kindness is enough, and how much is too much? It is a cruel world. Harshness is the tenor of much dialogue, from the US president down. Simple kindness may well make the difference between contentment and misery. That is the attitude Kind Snacks is out to promote. Its mission is to “make the world a little kinder”. Its website positively drips with benevolence. Kind has set up a Kind Foundation, fostering “kinder and more empathetic communities”; it hands out #kindawesome cards when it sees someone being kind; it offers tips about how to be kind every day. Last week, Mars bought a minority stake and is ready to push Kind’s sticky bars and their somewhat cloying message into even more countries. Much of Kind’s activity is marketing — the token of Kind’s appreciation for acts of kindness is a free snack — and some approaches the border of creepiness. This was the week Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with Garrison Keillor, whose Lake Wobegon is a fictional archetype of a kind, compassionate community, while it looked into allegations of “inappropriate behaviour”. It may not be the moment to “drop a loving note into a friend’s bag for them to discover later” — one of Kind’s tips — unless you know that friend very well, or don’t mind if your human resources Swat team pays you an urgent visit. Yet there is a kernel of truth behind the flummery. Kind makes a useful distinction between mere niceness, which is passive, and active kindness. Its founder Daniel Lubetzky was inspired by his father’s tale of how he survived Dachau, in part because of the unexpected kindness of a concentration camp guard, who broke the rules to give him a rotten potato. What is more, research confirms workplace warmheartedness has wider benefits. A University of California study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behaviour — “paying it forward” — while givers and receivers felt a greater sense of autonomy, and were happier all around. Another study in the Academy of Management Journal highlighted the importance of “companionate love” in the male-dominated world of firefighting. When combined with a culture of “joviality”, acts of kindness — such as raising money to help a financially troubled colleague hang on to his house — moderated risk-taking and reduced health problems triggered by the strain of balancing work and family. As in so many other areas, though, kindness gets more complicated as people climb the corporate hierarchy. I suggested to some chief executives that one risk of including “decency” in your corporate values was that staff might consider you had broken your promise if you had to sack them. One promptly fired back, to widespread nodding, that a far graver breach would be to keep staff on at the expense of the company’s long-term health. Companies are occasionally killed by kindness. The owner of Malden Mills, a Massachusetts textile company, rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire in 1995, instead of offshoring production. His benevolence backfired. He misread the global market and plunged everybody into bankruptcy. It was “a cautionary tale about adventures in the frontier” of efforts to make the world a better place, wrote academic Roger Martin. Similarly, Etsy, the crafts market operating on the same frontier, has had to toughen its sensitive side and ditch its folksy chief executive to survive as a listed company. “Being good does","date":"2023-06-28","objectID":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/:0:0","tags":["Andrew Hill","business","FT","english","cleft sentence"],"title":"Why It Can Be Cruel to Be Kind in the Workplace","uri":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/"},{"categories":["article"],"content":"Killed by Kindness This phrase is used to denote a situation where one’s good intentions or excessive generosity lead to negative outcomes.
