They launched a tech start-up, armed with an AI product they believed would revolutionize the industry. The investors shared their belief, seeing the project as a no-brainer opportunity worth backing. However, the duo chose a risky path, putting all their eggs in one basket, betting everything on the success of their AI project. They worked relentlessly, often providing their investors with ballpark figures to keep them in the loop. Despite their tireless efforts, they found themselves falling behind schedule due to unforeseen technical issues. They quickly realized they were in the same boat - the potential failure of the start-up was a threat they both faced. Understanding the gravity of their situation, they knew they had to get on the same page. It was time to realign their thoughts and plans, focusing on the survival of their company. As challenging as it was, they found a way to see eye to eye on the future direction of their company. Their determination paid off when they finally solved the technical issues. Their AI product was a hit in the market, turning their struggling start-up into a successful company. The product was, indeed, the gamechanger they had always believed it would be.

The ideal candidate must “exude kindness”. As a rule, I would say that if you are actually sweating a quality, you are probably trying too hard. Nobody thinks “he oozes niceness” is a compliment. The requirement does, however, raise an interesting question: at work, how much kindness is enough, and how much is too much? It is a cruel world. Harshness is the tenor of much dialogue, from the US president down. Simple kindness may well make the difference between contentment and misery. That is the attitude Kind Snacks is out to promote. Its mission is to “make the world a little kinder”. Its website positively drips with benevolence. Kind has set up a Kind Foundation, fostering “kinder and more empathetic communities”; it hands out #kindawesome cards when it sees someone being kind; it offers tips about how to be kind every day. Last week, Mars bought a minority stake and is ready to push Kind’s sticky bars and their somewhat cloying message into even more countries. Much of Kind’s activity is marketing — the token of Kind’s appreciation for acts of kindness is a free snack — and some approaches the border of creepiness. This was the week Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with Garrison Keillor, whose Lake Wobegon is a fictional archetype of a kind, compassionate community, while it looked into allegations of “inappropriate behaviour”. It may not be the moment to “drop a loving note into a friend’s bag for them to discover later” — one of Kind’s tips — unless you know that friend very well, or don’t mind if your human resources Swat team pays you an urgent visit. Yet there is a kernel of truth behind the flummery. Kind makes a useful distinction between mere niceness, which is passive, and active kindness. Its founder Daniel Lubetzky was inspired by his father’s tale of how he survived Dachau, in part because of the unexpected kindness of a concentration camp guard, who broke the rules to give him a rotten potato. What is more, research confirms workplace warmheartedness has wider benefits. A University of California study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behaviour — “paying it forward” — while givers and receivers felt a greater sense of autonomy, and were happier all around. Another study in the Academy of Management Journal highlighted the importance of “companionate love” in the male-dominated world of firefighting. When combined with a culture of “joviality”, acts of kindness — such as raising money to help a financially troubled colleague hang on to his house — moderated risk-taking and reduced health problems triggered by the strain of balancing work and family. As in so many other areas, though, kindness gets more complicated as people climb the corporate hierarchy. I suggested to some chief executives that one risk of including “decency” in your corporate values was that staff might consider you had broken your promise if you had to sack them. One promptly fired back, to widespread nodding, that a far graver breach would be to keep staff on at the expense of the company’s long-term health. Companies are occasionally killed by kindness. The owner of Malden Mills, a Massachusetts textile company, rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire in 1995, instead of offshoring production. His benevolence backfired. He misread the global market and plunged everybody into bankruptcy. It was “a cautionary tale about adventures in the frontier” of efforts to make the world a better place, wrote academic Roger Martin. Similarly, Etsy, the crafts market operating on the same frontier, has had to toughen its sensitive side and ditch its folksy chief executive to survive as a listed company. “Being good do","date":"2023-06-28","objectID":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/:0:0","tags":["Andrew Hill","business","FT","english","cleft sentence"],"title":"Why It Can Be Cruel to Be Kind in the Workplace","uri":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/"},{"categories":["article"],"content":"Killed by Kindness This phrase is used to denote a situation where one’s good intentions or excessive generosity lead to negative outcomes.

His good intentions, however, misjudged the global market situation and led to bankruptcy. In this case, the company was “killed by kindness”.
