On an ordinary afternoon, I sit by the window, soaking up the warm sunlight. Time passes slowly, and the dusty, age-old memories that have been collecting in a corner of my mind start to wake up from their slumber. In this unexpected moment of leisure, coffee is an inevitable thought. Even in the seemingly simple act of boiling water, happiness seeps in. Watching the hot water slowly start to boil, I temporarily put down the weight of my future concerns. The sight of the green trees and terraced houses outside my window provides a soothing embrace. At that moment, the neighbor’s cat comes out for a stroll. She, as always, finds her way onto my deck, surveying her surroundings with eyes full of curiosity. ‘Perhaps, she too is enjoying this leisure time just like me?’ I ponder as I watch her. During these tranquil moments as they pass by, I discover the quiet beauty of everyday life. Like the aroma of coffee, a simple yet serene happiness fills my heart. Savoring this scent, I slowly lift my cup of coffee.

How do you send money without a bank account or the internet? Some countries have various options, including PayPal, online banking, or money orders. However, many people in rural communities don’t have access to basic banking services such as direct debit. There are two billion 'unbanked' adults in developing countries that cannot make transactions or transfer money. Their credit cards are unstable because they have no way to save for the future. Giving people access to banking is called 'financial inclusion'. By lowering the cost of transactions, financial inclusion encourages economic growth. Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. It is easy to use, has low fees, and doesn’t involve credit cards. All you need is an old mobile phone, and money is sent via text messages. Most customers use it for person-to-person (P2P) payments, but some use it to pay utility bills. Useful Expressions Financial inclusion: This term refers to the process of providing access to basic financial services, such as banking and payment systems, to individuals who are traditionally excluded from such services. It aims to bridge the gap between individuals and the formal financial system, enabling them to save, make transactions, and access other financial services. The expression “financial inclusion” emphasizes the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to affordable and convenient financial services. ‘Unbanked’ adults: This phrase refers to individuals who do not have access to or do not use formal banking services. They lack bank accounts and rely on alternative methods for financial transactions and money management. The term “unbanked” highlights the lack of financial inclusion for these individuals and the challenges they face in participating in the formal financial system. Mobile banking: Mobile banking refers to the use of mobile phones or other mobile devices to conduct financial transactions and access financial services. In the context of the article, it is mentioned that Kenya has brought many people into its financial system with mobile banking. This expression underscores the role of mobile technology in expanding financial inclusion, particularly in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Person-to-person (P2P) payments: P2P payments refer to transactions where funds are transferred directly from one individual to another, typically using electronic or mobile payment systems. In the article, it is mentioned that most customers in Kenya use mobile banking for P2P payments. This expression highlights the common use of mobile banking for person-to-person financial transactions, enabling individuals to send and receive money conveniently and securely. Utility bills: Utility bills are invoices or statements that represent charges for essential services such as electricity, water, or gas. In the article, it is mentioned that some customers in Kenya use mobile banking to pay their utility bills. This expression emphasizes the use of mobile banking as a convenient and accessible method for individuals to settle their utility expenses. Traditional banking services: Traditional banking services are the conventional methods and offerings provided by banks, such as physical branches, ATMs, and face-to-face interactions. In the article, it mentions that many people in rural communities lack access to basic banking services, including traditional banking facilities. This expression emphasizes the need for alternative solutions in areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Credit cards: Credit cards are plastic cards issued by financial institutions that allow individuals to borrow funds up to a certain limit to make purchases.

However, the duo chose a risky path, putting all their eggs in one basket, betting everything on the success of their AI project. They worked relentlessly, often providing their investors with ballpark figures to keep them in the loop. Despite their tireless efforts, they found themselves falling behind schedule due to unforeseen technical issues. They quickly realized they were in the same boat - the potential failure of the start-up was a threat they both faced.

The ideal candidate must “exude kindness”. As a rule, I would say that if you are actually sweating a quality, you are probably trying too hard. Nobody thinks “he oozes niceness” is a compliment. The requirement does, however, raise an interesting question: at work, how much kindness is enough, and how much is too much? It is a cruel world. Harshness is the tenor of much dialogue, from the US president down. Simple kindness may well make the difference between contentment and misery. That is the attitude Kind Snacks is out to promote. Its mission is to “make the world a little kinder”. Its website positively drips with benevolence. Kind has set up a Kind Foundation, fostering “kinder and more empathetic communities”; it hands out #kindawesome cards when it sees someone being kind; it offers tips about how to be kind every day. Last week, Mars bought a minority stake and is ready to push Kind’s sticky bars and their somewhat cloying message into even more countries. Much of Kind’s activity is marketing — the token of Kind’s appreciation for acts of kindness is a free snack — and some approaches the border of creepiness. This was the week Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with Garrison Keillor, whose Lake Wobegon is a fictional archetype of a kind, compassionate community, while it looked into allegations of “inappropriate behaviour”. It may not be the moment to “drop a loving note into a friend’s bag for them to discover later” — one of Kind’s tips — unless you know that friend very well, or don’t mind if your human resources Swat team pays you an urgent visit. Yet there is a kernel of truth behind the flummery. Kind makes a useful distinction between mere niceness, which is passive, and active kindness. Its founder Daniel Lubetzky was inspired by his father’s tale of how he survived Dachau, in part because of the unexpected kindness of a concentration camp guard, who broke the rules to give him a rotten potato. What is more, research confirms workplace warmheartedness has wider benefits. A University of California study at Coca-Cola’s Madrid site showed workers who benefited from small acts of kindness amplified their own positive behaviour — “paying it forward” — while givers and receivers felt a greater sense of autonomy, and were happier all around. Another study in the Academy of Management Journal highlighted the importance of “companionate love” in the male-dominated world of firefighting. When combined with a culture of “joviality”, acts of kindness — such as raising money to help a financially troubled colleague hang on to his house — moderated risk-taking and reduced health problems triggered by the strain of balancing work and family. As in so many other areas, though, kindness gets more complicated as people climb the corporate hierarchy. I suggested to some chief executives that one risk of including “decency” in your corporate values was that staff might consider you had broken your promise if you had to sack them. One promptly fired back, to widespread nodding, that a far graver breach would be to keep staff on at the expense of the company’s long-term health. Companies are occasionally killed by kindness. The owner of Malden Mills, a Massachusetts textile company, rehired his entire workforce after a catastrophic fire in 1995, instead of offshoring production. His benevolence backfired. He misread the global market and plunged everybody into bankruptcy. It was “a cautionary tale about adventures in the frontier” of efforts to make the world a better place, wrote academic Roger Martin. Similarly, Etsy, the crafts market operating on the same frontier, has had to toughen its sensitive side and ditch its folksy chief executive to survive as a listed company. “Being good does","date":"2023-06-28","objectID":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/:0:0","tags":["Andrew Hill","business","FT","english","cleft sentence"],"title":"Why It Can Be Cruel to Be Kind in the Workplace","uri":"/why-it-can-be-cruel-to-be-kind-in-the-workplace/"},{"categories":["article"],"content":"Killed by Kindness This phrase is used to denote a situation where one’s good intentions or excessive generosity lead to negative outcomes.
