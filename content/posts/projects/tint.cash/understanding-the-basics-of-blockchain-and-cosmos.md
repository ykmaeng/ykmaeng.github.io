#### Blockchain

A blockchain is essentially a distributed, digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This allows users to verify and audit transactions independently.

In a blockchain, each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks.

#### Cosmos

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains. It's built on a set of open source tools like Tendermint, the Cosmos SDK, and IBC designed to let people build custom, secure, scalable, and interoperable blockchain applications quickly.

- **Tendermint**: It's the foundation of Cosmos, providing the networking and consensus layers of the Cosmos ecosystem. Tendermint Core is a software implementation of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm.

- **Cosmos SDK**: This is a modular framework for building interoperable, application-specific blockchains. It allows developers to customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic without considering the complex underlying protocol.

- **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol)**: This is a protocol for secure, reliable, and high-speed communication between blockchains.

- **ATOM**: It's the native token of the Cosmos network. It's primarily used for staking on the Cosmos Hub, which is the first blockchain to be launched in the Cosmos Network.

Understanding these concepts is crucial before starting to build your own blockchain. It's recommended to read more about these topics, and possibly follow some online tutorials or courses to get a solid understanding.
