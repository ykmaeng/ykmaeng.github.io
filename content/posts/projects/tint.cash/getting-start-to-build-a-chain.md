Building a blockchain with the Cosmos SDK, which uses ATOM for its native token, involves several steps. Here's a general overview of how you could get started:

### Understand the Basics of Blockchain and Cosmos

Before you start building your blockchain, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology. You should also familiarize yourself with Cosmos Network, its architecture, and its unique features such as interoperability and sovereignty.

### Install the Necessary Tools

To start building your blockchain, you'll need to install a few development tools. The primary language for Cosmos SDK is Go, so you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You might also need other tools depending on your project requirements.

### Learn Go Programming Language

If you're not already familiar with it, you'll need to learn the Go programming language. This is the primary language used in the Cosmos SDK, and it's important to have a good grasp of it before you start building your blockchain.

### Get Familiar with the Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is a modular framework that provides the necessary building blocks to build a blockchain application. You'll want to familiarize yourself with the SDK and its modules. Spend some time going through the documentation and understand how to use it effectively.

### Start Building

Once you have a good understanding of Go and the Cosmos SDK, you can start building your blockchain. Begin by initializing a new blockchain project with the SDK, and then build out the features you need. This could include things like defining your blockchain's transaction types, implementing your blockchain's logic, and setting up validators.

### Testing your Blockchain

After building your blockchain, it's crucial to test it thoroughly. This includes unit testing your code, as well as running simulations to ensure that your blockchain operates as expected in different scenarios.

### Launching and Maintaining your Blockchain

Once you're confident in your blockchain's functionality and security, you can launch it. However, your work isn't done after launch â€“ you'll need to actively maintain your blockchain, fix bugs, and potentially add new features over time.

Remember, this is a complex project that requires a deep understanding of several different technologies. Take your time to learn and understand each step thoroughly before moving on to the next. Good luck with your project!
