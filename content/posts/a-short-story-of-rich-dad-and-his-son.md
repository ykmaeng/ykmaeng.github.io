One day, a rich dad took his son on a trip to a village.

He wanted to show him how poor someone can be.

They spent time on the farm of a poor family.

On their return from the trip, the father asked his son,

**"How was the trip?"**

**"It was great, Dad".**

**"Did you see how poor people live?"** the father asked.

**"Oh yes"** said the son.

**"So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?"** asked the father.

The son answered:

**"We have one dog; they like four. We have a pool; they have rivers. We have tube lights at night; they have stars. We buy food; they grow theirs. We have walls to protect us; they have friends. We have television; they spend time with family and relatives".**

The boy's father was speechless. Then his son added:

**"Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor We are".**
