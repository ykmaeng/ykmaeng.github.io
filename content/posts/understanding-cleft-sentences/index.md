Cleft sentences are a type of sentence structure used in English for emphasis or to bring a particular part of a sentence into focus. It splits a simple sentence into two clauses, with the primary information being isolated for emphasis.

## Basic It-Cleft Sentence

Let's take a simple sentence like: "John ate the apple."

A **basic it-cleft sentence** might look like: "It was John who ate the apple." This places emphasis on the fact that it was John who performed the action.

We can also modify the cleft to focus on different parts of the sentence:

{{< admonition type=example open=true >}}

- "It was the apple that John ate." This emphasizes the object, the apple.

- "What John did was eat the apple." Emphasizes the action itself.

- "It is books that Sarah reads." Emphasizes the object, "books."

- "It was yesterday that Sarah read a book." Focuses on the time, "yesterday."

## Pseudo-Cleft or Wh-Cleft Sentence

There is also the **pseudo-cleft** or **wh-cleft** sentence structure, which flips the two halves of an it-cleft. For instance, "What John ate was the apple."

{{< admonition type=example open=true >}}

- "What I need to do now is finish the report." The emphasis is on the action of finishing the report.

- "What really makes me happy is spending time with my family." The focus is on the event that causes happiness.

{{< /admonition >}}

## Thing/Things-Cleft

When the focus is on a thing or things, often an action or event, we can use a **thing/things-cleft** structure.

{{< admonition type=example open=true >}}

- "One thing that really matters in life is to stay true to yourself." Here, staying true to oneself is emphasized.

- "The thing I love most about summer is the warm weather." Here, "the warm weather" is emphasized as the main thing the speaker loves about summer.

- "The thing that surprised me most was his sudden decision to quit." The surprising element is emphasized, which is "his sudden decision to quit."

{{< /admonition >}}

## Someone/Something-Cleft

In this structure, the focus is on someone or something. 

{{< admonition type=example open=true >}}

- "Someone who really inspires me is my professor." Here, the cleft sentence emphasizes "my professor" as the inspiring person.

- "Something that always makes me smile is my dog's antics." Here, "my dog's antics" are highlighted as the thing that makes the speaker smile.

Remember, cleft sentences are an excellent tool for creating emphasis in your speech or writing. They allow you to highlight the information that you find most important, and can also add variety to your language.
