#### Title: "The Digital Age: Navigating the Crisis in Literacy"

In the age of **screen media**, there is an unfolding crisis in **literacy** that is subtly **exacerbating illiteracy**, and it's a crisis that we need to address urgently. As **the internet has increasingly usurped the role of authority** from traditional print media as the primary source of information, it is not just the **bookworms** who are feeling the pinch. The rise of the digital domain has notably been **eroding our critical thinking** skills and, in some cases, is further **exacerbating the issue of functional illiteracy**.

While being **computer literate** or **computer savvy** is deemed essential in the 21st century, **there is a distinction between** being able to navigate a website and comprehending the content therein. The challenge is not just about promoting **literacy** but ensuring that the **literate** can effectively interpret and understand the information they encounter.

A **pessimistic view** would suggest that the digital age is an unwelcome change, undermining the value of being **literate**. However, the reality is not so black and white. The internet and other forms of **screen media** have also opened new doors and presented alternative **ways of acquiring knowledge**.

For instance, **multimedia libraries** have emerged as a valuable resource, providing access to hundreds of books, documentaries, and educational materials at the click of a button. In many ways, the digital revolution **enhances creativity**, offering a plethora of resources that were previously unimaginable.

The solution to this crisis lies not in resisting the digital revolution, but in harnessing its potential. As educators, it is our responsibility to **integrate new technologies into the school curriculum**, blending them with traditional teaching methods to create a holistic learning experience.

**Initiatives to promote reading programs**, alongside teaching digital **literacy**, are required to combat this crisis. The classroom of the future should not see digital and print media as adversaries but use them in tandem to foster a robust learning environment. In this way, we can ensure that **print media retains its authority** as a trusted source of information while also leveraging the benefits of digital tools.

The crisis in **literacy** is a complex issue that demands immediate attention. However, by acknowledging the challenges and embracing the opportunities offered by the digital age, we can work towards a future where literacy extends beyond just being able to read and write. It should encompass the ability to understand, interpret, and critically evaluate the information we encounter, regardless of the medium.
