#### My Writing:

The bar chart displays the proportions of four different types used to commute to work in a European city. This survey was conducted every two decades, from 1950 to 1990.

Overall, it represents that, at the beginning of the survey, more eco-friendly tools, such as walking and bicycles, were the primary modes of transportation, whereas commuting by car became the principle means at the end of the investigation.

To begin with, in 1950, commuting on foot recorded the highest with 35%, followed by bike, bus, and car in order. On foot, there was a dramatic decrease trend to 1990, shown as 5% of the proportion. As for the bus, it presented a similar trend to the foot, starting at 30% and falling down to 5%. In terms of the bus, it showed marginal changes, going from 20% at first to 25% and then 15% in the end. Turning to the car, it was depicted as an exponential increase, beginning at 5% and reaching 35%. (164 words)

The bar chart provides data on the percentages of different modes of commuting in a European city over four decades, from 1950 to 1990. The modes of commuting considered are walking, cycling, bus, and car.

The most striking trend is the major shift from more eco-friendly modes of commuting, such as walking and cycling, to car use by the end of the period.

In 1950, the majority of commuters walked to work, accounting for 35% of the total. However, by 1990, this had dramatically fallen to just 5%. Similarly, commuting by bus also saw a significant drop from 30% in 1950 to 5% in 1990.

On the other hand, the use of bicycles for commuting experienced only slight fluctuations, starting at 20% in 1950, peaking at 25% in the middle of the period, and then falling to 15% by 1990.

Car use, on the other hand, showed remarkable growth over the period, starting at a mere 5% in 1950 and shooting up to 35% by 1990.

In conclusion, while walking and bus use as commuting options reduced drastically over the period, the use of cars surged, becoming the primary mode of commuting by 1990. (194 words)
