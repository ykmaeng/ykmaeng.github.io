![Chart](ielts-chart-dubai.png "Average Temperature and Rainfall in Dubai")

The table and line graph `present` the `monthly variations` in average temperature and rainfall in Dubai throughout the year. `The purpose of these surveys is to discern` patterns and correlations between temperature and precipitation `over the course of a year`. The units of measurement are degrees Celsius for temperature and centimetres for rainfall. The data has been collected from the Dubai Meteorological Department.

Overall, `there is a noticeable correlation between` the annual temperature and rainfall in Dubai. `Specifically`, the warmer months tend to have less rainfall, `emphasising that` the hotter months are typically drier.

`To begin with`, in the months of January and February, the minimum temperature was `recorded at` 14°C and the maximum at 25°C. `Following that`, in March and April, there was an uptick in both minimum and maximum temperatures, `recorded at` 17°C and 32°C, respectively. `In terms of the trend`, the temperature `consistently rose as the months progressed`. By July and August, the minimum temperature reached its `peak at` 29°C, while the maximum soared to a sweltering 48°C. `With regard to the maximum temperature`, it demonstrated a `consistent increase` from January, peaking in July-August, and then seeing a `decline towards` the end of the year.

`Turning to annual rainfall`, January started with 14 cm. This figure surged, `peaking at` 32 cm in February. `This was followed by` a `steep drop`, with May registering no rainfall, a trend that persisted until October. `In the ensuing months`, `notably` after October, there was a `sharp rise` in precipitation, with December recording 16 cm.

`In terms of the overall patterns`, while temperatures in Dubai rise during the middle of the year, rainfall experiences a decline, `underscoring the inverse relationship between these two variables in the region.` (285 words)
