#### Speaking Part 2 (1 minute to prepare / 2 minutes to speak)

{{< admonition question "1. Describe a school project that you have participated in" false >}}
When I think back to my school days, my memory goes back to a particular show worth talking about, which I participated in during my senior year. This was not just any school project. It was a fund-raising project organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, aimed to raise funds for a charitable organisation for underprivileged children.

The entire class embarked upon a programme of staging a quiz show. It was a unified approach where everyone had a role to play. The planning was tedious and time-consuming, as we wanted to ensure everything would go smoothly on the big day.

I vividly recall the day before the event, when the stage was meticulously prepared. We spent hours ensuring each prop was in its place, and the place was flamboyantly decorated, creating a merry-making atmosphere.

This event fostered the spirit of the community, as it was a community project that brought students, teachers, and parents together. The show itself was one of a kind, with interesting questions and enthusiastic participants. The teamwork was effective and efficient, and the show ended with a thunderous applause from the audience.

The collection from the show went towards the charitable organisation we were supporting. In the end, the event was a resounding success. Ultimately, the determination and perseverance of the organising committee paid off. It was a memorable experience that taught me the value of collaboration and working towards a noble cause.

{{< admonition question "2. Describe a stranger you have helped" false >}}
My memory goes back to just a couple of years ago, when I embarked upon a programme of volunteering at a local soup kitchen. This was not a part of any school project or community event, but rather a personal initiative that I undertook in my free time.

One day, as I was serving meals, a stranger walked in. He was shabbily dressed and looked a bit lost. I could tell he was uncomfortable and probably hadn't done something like this before. I approached him and offered him a warm meal. He was hesitant at first, but eventually accepted my offer.

The process of helping him was not as straightforward as I had expected. It was a unified approach, requiring the cooperation of several volunteers to ensure he was comfortable and well taken care of. The planning was tedious and time-consuming, as we had to cater to his specific needs and ensure that he felt welcomed and not judged.

Ultimately, the determination and perseverance of everyone involved paid off. We managed to provide him with a warm meal and some much-needed company. The event was a resounding success in my eyes. Even though it was a small act, it fostered the spirit of community within me.

This experience was a stark reminder that we all have the capacity to help others in need, and it reinforced my commitment to volunteering and helping those less fortunate. It was one of a kind experience that I will always remember.

{{< admonition question "3. Describe someone you have helped" false >}}
Certainly, I'd be glad to share about a time when I was able to lend a helping hand. My memory goes back to my college years, when I embarked upon a programme to assist one of my classmates who was struggling academically.

This endeavour was not organised under the auspices of any official body, rather it was a unified approach among a group of us who saw a friend in need. The planning was tedious and time-consuming, as we had to juggle our own academic responsibilities along with this additional commitment. However, the day before the first tutoring session, we meticulously prepared our materials, ensuring we were as equipped as possible to assist our friend.

The sessions fostered the spirit of community among us, transforming from mere academic aid into a community project. We'd often study together in the library, which we flamboyantly decorated with motivational quotes and posters. Our collective efforts created a merry-making atmosphere, where learning was enjoyable and rewarding.

Ultimately, the determination and perseverance of our small organising committee paid off. Our friend's academic performance significantly improved, and the experience brought us all closer. The success of this endeavour was a resounding one, and I believe our effective and efficient teamwork played a huge role in this. It was truly one of a kind experience for all of us.

{{< admonition question "4. Describe someone who has helped you" false >}}
A person who comes to mind when I think of someone who has significantly helped me is my high school teacher, Mrs. Johnson. My memory goes back to my high school years when I was struggling with mathematics.

Mrs. Johnson embarked upon a programme to provide extra assistance to students who were having difficulty in the subject. This was organised under the auspices of the school's commitment to ensuring every student succeeded. Her approach to teaching was a unified one -- she believed in connecting different topics to help students see the bigger picture.

The planning on her part was surely tedious and time-consuming. She'd stay after school hours and even come in early before the school day began to prepare lessons that were meticulously tailored to our needs. Her classroom was always flamboyantly decorated with educational posters and examples of student work, creating a warm, welcoming, and merry-making atmosphere that made learning enjoyable.

Her determination and perseverance paid off when I finally began to grasp the concepts that had previously eluded me. The help she provided was a resounding success, and I credit a large part of my academic improvement to her support. Her effective and efficient approach to teaching and her commitment to her students was one of a kind. Looking back, her help was instrumental in shaping my academic journey and fostering my love for learning.

A place full of colours that I would like to describe is a vibrant street market that I visited during a cultural festival in my hometown. This market was flamboyantly decorated with multicoloured banners, lights, and decorations, making it a place full of life and colours.

Every corner of the market was filled with stalls selling a variety of goods.

A family activity that has left a lasting impression on me and is worth talking about is the annual charity fun run that my family participates in. My memory goes back to the first time we got involved, several years ago.

This activity was organized under the auspices of a local charitable organization for disadvantaged children. It was a fund-raising project, and the aim was to raise funds for providing educational resources to these children. My entire family embarked upon a programme to train for the run, turning it into a unified effort.

The preparation for the event could sometimes be tedious and time-consuming, especially balancing work, school, and other commitments. However, the day before the event always brought a sense of excitement. We would diligently prepare our running gear and ensure our donation pledges were in order.

{{< admonition question "8. Describe an ambition that you have not achieved" false >}}
An ambition that I have yet to achieve is to write and publish my own novel. Ever since I was a child, I have been enamoured with the idea of crafting a world entirely of my own creation, filled with characters and stories that could captivate readers and transport them to another reality.

I have always admired the way authors can weave intricate narratives that hold the power to inspire, provoke thought, and stir emotions. I would often find myself lost in the pages of a book, completely absorbed in the unfolding drama, and it's this magical quality of storytelling that I aspire to replicate.

To date, I have written numerous short stories and even completed a few drafts of what could eventually become my debut novel. However, the process of writing a full-length novel is a significant undertaking. It requires not just creativity and a way with words, but also a great deal of patience, dedication, and most importantly, time, which is often a scarce resource.

Despite this, I remain undeterred. I continually strive to improve my writing skills, seeking feedback from others and learning from my own mistakes. I take inspiration from the world around me, constantly jotting down ideas and observations that could be woven into my story.

Although I have not yet fulfilled this ambition, I believe that each day brings me one step closer to achieving it. The journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I look forward to the day when I can finally hold a copy of my published novel in my hands.

{{< admonition question "9. Describe a situation that you got up extremely early" false >}}
One situation that required me to get up extremely early was when I decided to trek up Mount Fuji in Japan. Known for its majestic beauty and iconic status, Mount Fuji is a popular destination for both local and international tourists. One of the highlights of this trip is watching the sunrise from the summit, an event that requires trekkers to start their ascent in the middle of the night.

My alarm went off at 1:00 AM, jolting me awake from a light sleep. Despite the bone-deep fatigue and the disorienting darkness, the anticipation of the journey ahead was electrifying. My travel companions and I quickly prepared ourselves, checking our gear, filling our water bottles, and packing some light snacks.

The trek was challenging, to say the least. The steep incline, thin air, and biting cold tested our physical endurance and mental resilience. But we pressed on, guided by the beams of our flashlights and the distant twinkle of stars. We were surrounded by hundreds of other trekkers, their quiet determination adding to the surreal atmosphere.

Finally, after hours of strenuous hiking, we reached the summit just as the first light of dawn was breaking. The view was breathtaking — a vast expanse of sky slowly lit by the warm hues of the sunrise. The sight of the sun peeking over the horizon, bathing the world below in a soft, ethereal glow, made every moment of the grueling trek worth it.

Getting up so early was a challenge, but the reward was an unforgettable experience and a memory I will cherish forever.
