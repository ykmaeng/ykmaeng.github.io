#### My Writing:

The statistical charts display the figures in numbers and the correlation between different reasons and destinations over the years from 1994 to 1998. In this investigation, 100,000 people from the UK participated.
 
Overall, the survey shows that UK residents preferred travelling to Western Europe during holidays, and there was a steady increase except in 1994.

To begin with, the most notable feature was seen in the category of 'Holiday' in 1994, with 15,246, and it increased dramatically by 1998, with 20,700. Following that, 'Business' was recorded starting with 3155, experiencing a continuous increase, and it reached 3181 by the end.
This was followed by 'Visit to friends and relatives', showing a similar trend to Holiday, which increased considerably from 1,689 to 3,051. With regard to 'Other reasons', it presented an irregular tendency, and figures ranged from 896 to 1,054.

Turning to destinations, Western Euope showed the most outstanding feature, increasing from 19,371 in 1994 to 24,519 in 1998. Both 'Other areas' and 'North America' had a proportional pattern where the former increased from 1,782 to 2,846 while the latter climbed from 919 to 1,923. (184 words)

Your report is well-structured and comprehensive. You've done a great job in presenting a clear overview in the beginning and then detailing each chart separately. Your use of language is also impressive; you've effectively employed a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures.

Here are a few suggestions for improvement:

1. **Introduction**: You could make your introduction more engaging by paraphrasing the question. For instance, "The provided statistical charts illustrate the relationship between different travel purposes and preferred destinations over a five-year period from 1994 to 1998, with data collected from 100,000 UK residents."

2. **Data Interpretation**: You've mentioned the numbers accurately, but it could be more insightful to include some comparisons or contrasts between the categories.

3. **Conclusion**: While not always necessary in a report like this, a brief summary or conclusion could help to round off your writing. You could indicate any overall trends or patterns that stand out across all the data.

4. **Variety of Language**: You've done a good job varying your language, but there's still room for a bit more variety in how you describe trends. For example, instead of repeating "increase" you could use "rise", "growth", "climb", etc.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep refining your writing skills and you'll do great in your IELTS exam. Good luck!

The two statistical charts provide a comparison of the various reasons for travel, and the preferred destinations of 100,000 UK residents over a span of five years, from 1994 to 1998.

As an overarching trend, the data illustrates that UK residents showed a predilection for holidaying in Western Europe, with a consistent upward trend over the years, except for a slight dip in 1994.

Digging deeper into the reasons for travel, the category of 'Holiday' was predominant in 1994 with 15,246 participants, which saw a significant surge to reach 20,700 by 1998. 'Business' travel also increased steadily over this period, albeit modestly, starting at 3,155 and ending at 3,181. A similar trend was observed in the category of 'Visiting friends and relatives', which witnessed a substantial rise from 1,689 to 3,051. However, travel for 'Other reasons' fluctuated over the years, with figures oscillating between 896 and 1,054.

Shifting our focus to the preferred travel destinations, Western Europe was the most popular choice, escalating from 19,371 in 1994 to 24,519 in 1998. The categories of 'Other areas' and 'North America' showed proportional growth, with the former rising from 1,782 to 2,846 and the latter elevating from 919 to 1,923.

In summary, the period from 1994 to 1998 witnessed a surge in UK residents' preference for holidays, particularly in Western Europe. The data also showed a modest increase in business travel and visiting friends and relatives, whereas the motivations classified under 'Other reasons' fluctuated without a clear trend.
