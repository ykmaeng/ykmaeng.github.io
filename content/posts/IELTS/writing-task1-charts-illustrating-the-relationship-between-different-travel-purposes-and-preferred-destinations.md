#### My Writing:

The statistical charts display the figures in numbers and the correlation between different reasons and destinations over the years from 1994 to 1998. In this investigation, 100,000 people from the UK participated.
 
Overall, the survey shows that UK residents preferred travelling to Western Europe during holidays, and there was a steady increase except in 1994.

To begin with, the most notable feature was seen in the category of 'Holiday' in 1994, with 15,246, and it increased dramatically by 1998, with 20,700. Following that, 'Business' was recorded starting with 3155, experiencing a continuous increase, and it reached 3181 by the end.
This was followed by 'Visit to friends and relatives', showing a similar trend to Holiday, which increased considerably from 1,689 to 3,051. With regard to 'Other reasons', it presented an irregular tendency, and figures ranged from 896 to 1,054.

Turning to destinations, Western Euope showed the most outstanding feature, increasing from 19,371 in 1994 to 24,519 in 1998. Both 'Other areas' and 'North America' had a proportional pattern where the former increased from 1,782 to 2,846 while the latter climbed from 919 to 1,923. (184 words)

The given charts compare the number of UK residents who travelled abroad for different purposes and to different destinations from 1994 to 1998. The data is based on a survey of 100,000 people.

Overall, the charts show that Western Europe was the most popular destination for UK travellers, especially for holidays, and that the number of travellers increased steadily over the years, except for a slight drop in 1994.

In detail, the category of 'Holiday' had the highest number of travellers in each year, rising from 15,246 in 1994 to 20,700 in 1998. The category of 'Business' also showed a gradual increase from 3,155 to 3,181 over the same period. The category of 'Visit to friends and relatives' had a similar trend to 'Holiday', growing from 1,689 to 3,051. The category of 'Other reasons' had the lowest and most fluctuating number of travellers, ranging from 896 to 1,054.

As for the destinations, Western Europe accounted for the majority of travellers in each year, increasing from 19,371 in 1994 to 24,519 in 1998. The destination of 'Other areas' also saw a significant rise from 1,782 to 2,846 over the same period. The destination of 'North America' had a moderate increase from 919 to 1,923. The destination of 'Central and Eastern Europe' had the smallest and most stable number of travellers, staying around 500. (222 words)

Some suggestions for improvement are:

- Use a variety of words and phrases to describe the charts, such as 'compare', 'account for', 'show a gradual increase', etc.
- Use commas to separate clauses and numbers.
- Use articles and prepositions correctly, such as 'the given charts', 'for different purposes', 'to different destinations', etc.
- Use past tense verbs to describe past data, such as 'had', 'rose', 'showed', etc.
- Use adverbs and adjectives to modify verbs and nouns, such as 'slightly', 'highest', 'significant', etc.
- Use transition words and phrases to connect sentences and paragraphs, such as 'Overall', 'In detail', 'As for', etc.
