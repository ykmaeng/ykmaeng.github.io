**Alex:** Hey Jamie, have you noticed how **fashion is a cycle**? I was going through my mom's old photos, and it seems what **it is in vogue** now was popular during her time too!

**Jamie:** Absolutely! I was shopping yesterday and saw so many **flamboyant clothes**. They reminded me of the 80s. But you know, I'm more **eclectic in my choice of clothes**. I love to **mix and match**.

**Alex:** Same here. Sometimes, I feel **it is cumbersome** to follow the latest trends. I mean, the **length of the skirt** or the color of the season changes so quickly. I believe **clothes reflect personality** more than anything else.

**Jamie:** That's so true. By the way, did you see the **national costume** exhibition downtown? It beautifully **shows the indigenous culture** of various countries. Made me quite **patriotic**!

**Alex:** Oh, I missed that! But I did attend a seminar on how brands shape our choices. It's fascinating how we live in such a **brand conscious society**. Some items are **prohibitively expensive**, yet people buy them just for the brand.

**Jamie:** I've seen that. But for me, if **it is reasonably priced** and looks good, it's a win. After all, it's not about the brand but how you carry it. I've always felt **it is fashionable** to be confident in whatever you wear.

**Alex:** Couldn't agree more. Speaking of fashion, are you attending Clara's party next week? I heard it's a themed party where we need to wear **traditional clothes**.

**Jamie:** Yes, I am! I've decided to wear my grandmother's dress. It's **one of a kind**. What about you?

**Alex:** Still deciding. I might go for a **casual** look but give it a **formal** twist. You know, just to keep things **trendy**!

**Jamie:** Sounds like a plan! Remember, fashion is all about having fun and expressing yourself.

Alex and Jamie are discussing fashion trends and their personal preferences. They both agree that fashion is cyclical, with trends from the past often resurfacing. They also express their individuality through their clothing choices, with Jamie mentioning their love for mixing and matching different styles.

They both find it challenging to keep up with the latest trends and believe that clothes should reflect one's personality rather than blindly following what is popular. Jamie mentions attending a national costume exhibition that showcased the indigenous culture of different countries, which made them feel patriotic.

Alex mentions attending a seminar on how brands influence consumer choices, noting that some expensive items are bought solely for the brand name. However, Jamie believes that the brand is not as important as how one carries themselves, and they prioritize affordability and personal style.

The conversation shifts to an upcoming themed party hosted by Clara, where traditional clothes are required. Jamie plans to wear their grandmother's unique dress, while Alex is still deciding on a casual look with a formal twist to stay trendy.

They conclude by emphasizing that fashion should be fun and a means of self-expression.
