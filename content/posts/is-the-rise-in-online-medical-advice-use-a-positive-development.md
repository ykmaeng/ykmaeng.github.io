### My writing

With the arrival of the digital age, the use of online medical advice is becoming increasingly common, and some are of the opinion that this is a positive trend, while others differ in opinion. Considering this situation, in my opinion, it is a positive development in terms of convenience and affordability.

To begin with, the use of online medical advice is on the rise as it is a practical approach. This is a time-saving and cost-effective approach due to the fact that people can access medical information and advice for a diverse range of conditions more easily. For example, first-aid information for less serious conditions will not require a doctor to assess the condition. This way of treatment leads to a feasible approach for mild or minor conditions, resulting in reducing the influx of patients with minor conditions at hospitals. Therefore, seeking online medical advice is an effective and pragmatic approach in this modern era.

On the other hand, using online medical advice may not be a good development, as there are drawbacks. The credibility of these online medical advice sites is unknown. Plus, although some incurable or chronic diseases may require professional expertise and periodic assessment by doctors, they can be unable to state the exact symptoms of their condition and may be given the wrong advice. This leads to inappropriately self-medicating, and consequently, the use of online medical advice may have an adverse effect on people.

In conclusion, online medical advice is a suitable approach for minor conditions, even though there is a possibility for this advice to be wrongly used. In my opinion, this is a positive development if it is treated with caution.

In the contemporary digital era, there's been a noticeable surge in people turning to online platforms for medical guidance. Views on this trend vary, with some seeing it as a positive shift and others expressing reservations. Personally, I view it as a beneficial development, provided it's approached judiciously.

One of the primary reasons for this growing trend is the sheer convenience it offers. Online medical platforms present a time-efficient and economically viable alternative to traditional consultations. For instance, minor ailments that require immediate yet basic care can be addressed without the need for a formal doctor's visit. This not only eases the burden on healthcare institutions but also provides immediate relief to patients for non-critical issues.

However, there are valid concerns about this digital shift. The reliability of information from various online sources can be questionable. Moreover, patients with severe or complex health issues might fail to convey their symptoms accurately online, leading to misguided advice. This could potentially lead to incorrect self-treatment, further complicating their health situation.

To sum up, while online medical guidance offers a convenient solution for minor health concerns, it's crucial to approach it with discernment. I believe that, when used wisely, it can be a beneficial addition to the medical landscape.
